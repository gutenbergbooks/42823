<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>"It has only recently been recognized as a
fact," says Prof. A. F. Bandelier, "<i>that on the
whole American continent</i>, the mode of life of the
primitive inhabitants was formed on <i>one</i> sociological
principle, and consequently the culture of
these peoples has varied, locally, only in <i>degree</i>,
not in <i>kind</i>. The religious principles were fundamentally
the same among the Sioux and the Brazilians,
and physical causes more than anything
else have been at the bottom of the local differences."
Such has been my own experience in
studying the stories of El Dorado which form the
subject of this book, and in presenting a man&mdash;a
culture hero&mdash;who came by sea from the East, I am
justified by a more complete set of records than is
known to the superficial student. As this man's
principles of life were the same, we are forced to
the conclusion that all the heroes were one conception,
handed down by oral tradition, but widely
separated as to locality, by the lapse of time, by
migrations and commercial relations of the different
tribes.</p>

<p>As to where these myths originated, or how
old they are, I have nothing to suggest, since in
presenting these simple variants, it is no concern of
mine. It is sufficient for my purpose to know that
they exist. To me they lend a dignity to our country
by investing it with a misty past, replete with
a mythology as rich and sublime as that of any of
the races of antiquity. Not only will the study of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
them inspire patriotism and make us better
acquainted with the inner lives of the red men, but
it will tend to create an interest in our sister
republics which cannot fail to be of lasting practical
benefit. We know much more of Europeans than
we do of the peoples of this continent.</p>

<p>If mythology is to be taught in the schools at
all, surely our own should have consideration, and
in familiarizing ourselves with the traditions of
El Dorado, we shall have one more incentive for
higher living. We shall learn that the great souls
of the races that have preceded us, in the Americas,
have faced the same problems of life, which are
the heritage of our common humanity; that within
its dark shadows they too have struggled, hoped,
and prayed.</p>

<p>No words incorporated into the English language
have been fraught with such <i>stupendous consequences</i>
as El Dorado. When the padres
attempted to tell the story of the Christ, the natives
exclaimed "El Dorado," or what the imperfect
translations have made El Dorado&mdash;the golden.
As the ignorant sailors and adventurers had been
kept from mutiny by Columbus' promise of gold,
it is no wonder that they seized upon the literal
meaning instead of the spiritual one.</p>

<p>The time, being that of Don Quixote and of
the Inquisition, accounts for the childish credulity
on one side and the unparalleled ferocity on the
other. The search for El Dorado, whether it was
believed to be a fabulous country of gold, or an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
inaccessible mountain, or a lake, or a city, or a
priest who anointed himself with a fragrant oil
and sprinkled his body with fine gold dust, must
always remain one of the blackest pages in the
history of the white race. The great heart of
humanity will ever ache with sympathy for the melancholy
and pitiful end of the natives, who at the
time of the conquest of Mexico were confidently
expecting the return of the mild and gentle Quetzalcoatl,
the Mexican variant of this universal
myth. None of the cruelties attributed to the
Indian had its origin in resistance to the acceptance
of a new faith. On the contrary he fought solely
in defense of his home, and from Patagonia to
Alaska was always willing to listen to the Christian
ideas of God and the hereafter.</p>

<p>I have devoted the first seven variants to the
original myth, while the others pertain to the transitions
to, and misconceptions of, the name El
Dorado. A lust for gold acquired by conquest was
the underlying motive of the discoveries and explorations
made in the western hemisphere, and is the
beginning of all American history. We have unconsciously
added some variants to it in California,
where the mythical kingdom of Quivera became the
land of gold of the '49 epoch. El Dorado has long
been a household word for anything rich and
golden.</p>

<p>I begin by bringing the Golden Hearted from
an island in the east, the Tlapalla, from whence he
came, and to which he returned in the legend. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
all variants he gave a distinct promise of return.
This accounts for the awe inspired by Europeans
in the minds of the natives, causing them everywhere
to fall easy victims to the unscrupulous
adventurers swarming into their country. That
there should have been confusion seems unavoidable
under the circumstances, but certainly Fate
never played a more cruel prank than to have one
race of men speak and act constantly from the
standpoint of tradition and religious belief, while
the other thought solely of material gain.</p>

<p>Only in Hiawatha and the Pueblo Montezuma
have I taken liberty with the original. The former
is based on the recent researches into Algonquin
and Chippewa myths of Michabo, the great White
Hare. In the Pueblo Montezuma I have followed
Prof. Bandelier as to the latest conceptions of the
Wrathy Chieftain. My authority for making the
Amazon Queens degenerate priestesses of the sun,
is J. A. Von Heuvel, the defender of Sir Walter
Raleigh's connection with the South American
version of the El Dorado legend. To Hubert Howe
Bancroft's abridgement of Father Sahagan's
translation of the Popol Vuh am I much indebted.</p>

<p>In all accessories I have utilized the products
or characteristics of localities visited by the mythical
hero, but have avoided investing him with a
religious character or surrounding him with
supernatural phenomena. It will be wise to make a
distinction between the purely mythical, and that
which led to history.

<h2>The Happy Island</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_010.jpg" style="margin-top:-2em" width="150" height="217"  alt="A" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">A LONG time ago there was a
beautiful island close by the
place in the east where the sun
rises. The sea was all around
it, and at noonday the sun in
the sky seemed to slant just
above it. Being near the equator
and in a tropic clime the
winds were soft and warm and
full of the odor of sweet flowers.
Sometimes the sea was smooth
and clear as glass and then the
goldfish and sea mosses floated
near the surface and glittered in the sunlight.</p>

<p>At night the moon came out big and round like
a silver ball and the stars shone very clear because
there was no smoke nor fog in the air. In the moonlight
the queer little flying fish would jump up out
of the water and dart forth and back in the funniest
way as if they were playing some kind of
game. Their tiny wet wings glistened like silver
gauze, and, when everything else was still, made a
peculiar whirring sound by all flapping at once.</p>

<p>The beach was strewn with quantities of conch
and abalone shells, also other species of all shapes
and sizes and they were as dainty in color as it is
possible to imagine. The children of the Happy
Island often held the larger ones to their ears to
listen to the murmurs and complaints of the
insects and other forms of life living inside them.
This was only a fancy, but many sea shells do have
a soft musical cadence if we care to hear it. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
poets believe that they were the first musical
instruments, and that the inhabitants of the sea
send messages ashore in this manner.</p>

<p>The ferns grew almost as tall as the trees and
there were hundreds of birds skimming through
the air, or flitting through the branches singing
and chattering and having a very happy time. They
were not afraid because no one threw stones at
them or tried to frighten them. Everybody was
glad to see them put up their little bills and ruffle
up their throats in singing, or else spread out their
wings and splash water all over their backs while
they stood on a pebble or twig taking a morning
bath. The people said that when the birds were
twittering and chirping they were talking to each
other. When they were singing they were telling
God how thankful they were for the warm sunshine
and plenty to eat.</p>

<p>There was a wonderful city in the center of the
island named the City of the Golden Gates
because it was surrounded by a high wall of very
thick stones, with a great number of gates of gold
through which the animals and people passed in
and out. Here lived the Old Man of the Sea, as
the king was called, and his son was a beautiful
youth known as the Golden Hearted because he
was so gentle and kind. He was a swift runner and
could shoot well with a bow and arrow and was
strong enough to wrestle with a big man, but he
preferred to make gold ornaments and vessels for
his father and was often permitted to go into the
king's treasure house to watch the workmen polish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the precious gems which they found in great
abundance by digging into the mountains near the
city.</p>

<p>The people knew all about white and black
pearls and how to get them from the bed of the
ocean. In full sight of the island was a large reef
of pink and white coral and the young prince went
there many times to see the curious little insects
building their graceful, airy houses over some rock
hidden by the water. He sometimes imagined that
he heard the mermaids calling to him. What he
really did hear was the wind dashing the waves
in and out of the coral chambers as if it were determined
to wash them away. The reef was an excellent
place to fish, and the Golden Hearted and
his companions had many a fine day's sport there
while the divers were searching for the pearl oysters.
He fished with a drag-net made by himself,
and he could let it out and haul it in again like a
regular sailor. He never killed any of the fish, and
the divers would not give him the pearls they found
because they were compelled to kill the oysters to
get them, and this they said made the pearls
unlucky and was the reason why they are round and
shining like tear drops. The miners brought him
all the emeralds they could find, because this was
the happiness-bringing stone. Its color is like
the soft grass in the springtime, and they wanted
him to be always young and have everything his
heart desired.</p>

<p>The royal gardens were his special care and
in them he was allowed to cultivate any kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
tree or plant or grain. Then from them he must
learn the names and habits of the trees producing
the best wood for building houses, what plants
were good to heal the sick, and all about the grains
useful for food either for man or animals. Every
flower that had a perfume grew in a separate part
of the garden, and those shedding their fragrance
at night only were in a bed by themselves. He was
required to know the difference between single and
double species and why there is such a difference
in the same family of plants.</p>

<p>Honey bees, big-winged butterflies, crickets
and beetles hid in the flowers or flew above them,
and these all taught a lesson to the young prince
who had no other books. The honey bee was an
industrious little fellow continually building a
piece of comb or else filling it with honey. The
butterfly, on the other hand, did not work at all but
changed from an ugly grub into a caterpillar and
finally into a gorgeous butterfly with spotted wings
and bright eyes. The king told his son that the
butterfly was like a soul&mdash;the immortal part of
ourselves&mdash;and he wished him to be as busy as the
bee, and to do no more harm to other creatures
than does the pretty butterfly.</p>

<p>The cricket was a cheerful, merry chap, usually
singing at the top of his voice, and the beetle
tried to push all of the dirt out of the garden. If
he found anything he did not like he would roll
and tumble with it, even if it were much bigger than
himself. This amused the Golden Hearted very
much, and when he grew tired of his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
occupations he would run out into the garden and
watch the beetles.</p>

<p>One day he went into the splendid throne-room
where his father was giving audience to some
wise old men who were foretelling what was
going to happen to the king and the people of the
Happy Island. They urged the king to send some
member of his household to the strange land over
the sea, toward the setting sun, where the people
were in barbarism.</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted was much interested and
thought here was an opportunity to do some good
for the weak and helpless. Springing forward he
said:</p>

<p>"Dear father, let me go. I am able to sail the
seas and am willing to devote my life to teaching
these poor people how to live like brothers."</p>

<p>The king felt proud of the young prince, but
he loved him so dearly that it was hard to let him
go, and also hard to refuse such a noble, manly
request.</p>

<p>"Do you know, my son, this will entail a great
deal of hardship and self-denial?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, father, but God intends us to earn all
the good things in life; He will not give them to us
for nothing. That is His good law, which makes
us healthy, happy and wise&mdash;three of the most
precious possessions in the world."</p>

<p>"Go, my Golden Heart, and may God bless
and keep you always," said the king. "Take a
green-throated humming-bird for your guide, and
when you find the land, journey on until you come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
to a place where a cactus grows at the base of a
rock and there is a golden eagle soaring in the air
above it. Halt there and found a city, and name
it in honor of the sun."</p>

<p>Then all the wise men begged to go with him,
and for days after there were great preparations
made for the departure of the king's son. At
daybreak one morning he set sail in a snake-skin
boat, and all the inhabitants came with the king to
throw flowers and emeralds into the sea because
they wished to show respect to the Golden Hearted.
It was their method of blessing him and wishing
him good luck. The whole shore line, as far as he
could see, was lighted up by bonfires where the
people burned resin and perfume to commemorate
his going.</p>

<p>At the water's edge stood the old sea king with
his long white hair and beard blowing in the wind.
By his side was a cream-white horse with three
plumes in the top of its bridle reins and a square,
red blanket edged with deep fringe on its back.
Crowns and moons and stars of gold and silver
were scattered over the blanket to show that the
horse belonged to the royal prince. Back of the
king was a long line of young warrior priests
mounted on white horses, with red blankets, and
carrying reversed spears in their hands. They
bowed their heads when the poor old father leaned
over on the horse's neck and cried as if his heart
would break as the boat with his only son in it
pushed off from the shore. Snatching a torch from
the hand of an attendant, the Golden Hearted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
waved it on high. Fire with them was a symbol of
wisdom, and when the king saw it, he answered
the signal by waving a torch, and the warrior
priests flashed their spears in the bright sunlight,
and the people sent up a deafening shout.</p>

<p>This meant that they were willing to sacrifice
their future king for the good of a strange race of
men who needed a teacher to show them how to
cultivate the land and how to build cities and live
civilized. The people of the Happy Island would
not send a common man for a teacher. No, indeed;
they gave the best they had&mdash;their dearly loved
prince with the golden heart&mdash;to help their less
fortunate neighbors. And he gave up all luxury
and comfort because he would rather be useful,
than live in ease as a king. The name of the island
was Atlantis, and the new country was our own&mdash;America.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">HO THERE! Who comes to us in
a canoe?" cried the people in the
strange land when the Golden
Hearted and the wise men
arrived from the Happy Island.
Many of the natives ran away
and others hid in the bushes
because they were afraid they
were going to be killed. None
of them were ever so badly frightened in their
lives, and none had ever seen white men before.</p>

<p>"Do you come to fight us? Are you warriors?"
they asked.</p>

<p>"I am your friend, not your foe," answered
the young prince kindly, and holding a white flag
high over his head. "To be a warrior is to have
been in many battles, and I never marched a day
under the banner of the king, my father. I come
wholly in peace."</p>

<p>"He is only a lad. Surely we need not fear
him," said the people coming back to crowd
around him on shore and to examine his boat and
clothes with much curiosity. "Why, then, are you
here?" they finally asked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sent by my father to teach you the Good
Law."</p>

<p>"We already know how to shoot an arrow
through the heart of an eagle. We have taken many
captives in battle, and are a scourge to our enemies,"
they answered proudly. They were still suspicious
of their visitors.</p>

<p>"You crush a worm without mercy, never
thinking it has the same right to live as you have,
and that in itself it is more wonderful than all these
things," said the Golden Hearted, reprovingly.</p>

<p>The natives were greatly astonished. Never
had they heard any one speak like this, and they
could not imagine what sort of young man he was.
If he did not like the chase, and was not a warrior,
and did not believe in killing things, they could
not understand him at all.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by the Good Law? What
is it anyhow?"</p>

<p>"It is to be gentle and kind to all creatures,
and to treat your neighbor as if he were your
brother. You must be just to the plant, to the bull,
to the horse and to the dog. The earth too has a
right to be cultivated. Neglect it, and it will curse
you; fertilize it, and it will show gratitude in a
thousand ways. May your fields bring forth all that
is good to eat, and may your countless villages
abound with prosperity."</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted was so modest and sincere
in speech and so well mannered that they were
pleased with him, and were beginning to feel quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
friendly. The wise men also said many nice things
to them and did all they could to make the situation
pleasant.</p>

<p>To show appreciation and to welcome the
young prince, the natives gave him a handful of
fireflies, because light with them was a symbol of
order, peace and virtue. This was a delicate,
pretty compliment and so delighted the Golden
Hearted that he scattered them all over his head.
When they lit in his soft, wavy, yellow hair, their
bulging eyes and gauzy wings sparkled like diamonds
and they did not try to fly away because
he sang to them:</p>

<p>"Firefly, firefly! bright little thing,
Light me to bed and my song I will sing.
Give me your light as you fly o'er my head
That I may merrily go to my bed.
Give me your light o'er the grass as you creep
That I may joyfully go to my sleep.
Come little firefly, come little beast,
Come and I'll make you tomorrow a feast;
Come, little candle, that flies as I sing,
Bright little fairy bug&mdash;Night's little king.
Come, and I'll dance as you guide me along,
Come, and I'll pay you, my bug, with a song."</p>

<p>Each fly has four spots, one back of each eye
and under each wing which it can make as bright
as candle light when it chooses. Its body is about
an inch and a half long.</p>

<p class="caption">"EACH STITCH MUST BE COUNTED"<br />
See <a href="#Page_28">page 28</a></p>
</div>

<p>When the prince put the fireflies in his hair,
the natives present touched the ground with their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
right hands and placed them over their hearts in
token of respect. He, in turn, gave them the white
flag he carried because it was an emblem of peace,
friendship, happiness and prosperity, as well as
purity and holiness, and he intended to bring them
all of these things.</p>

<p>"What is your wish?" asked the natives of
each of the wise men.</p>

<p>"We desire to bathe in the warm surf of these
shores and then to make a thank offering for our
safe arrival and your kindly greeting," they
answered.</p>

<p>Criers with shrill trumpets and drums ran
up and down the beach to call in the fishing boats.</p>

<p>"The men wearing skirts are coming into the
sea," they shouted, and the Golden Hearted and
his followers looked at each other with a smile
when they heard what the criers said. The natives
wore only breech clouts and feather and shell
ornaments, much like the Indians of today. Never
before had they seen men wearing long white robes,
beards and high-crowned hats without rims, and
having a square black cloth hanging over the
shoulders in the back like a veil.</p>

<p>"Is there something else needed to make you
more content and comfortable?" asked the criers
when the fishermen had all come ashore.</p>

<p>"We need wood and stones to build an altar
for our sacrifice," replied the Golden Hearted.</p>

<p>While the newcomers were splashing in the
surf, the porters brought arms full of wood, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
stones large and small and piled them near the
boat and waited to see what the visitors would do
with them.</p>

<p>"Why do you wear skirts like women?" they
next inquired, as the bathers were putting on their
robes after a long swim.</p>

<p>"Because we work for humanity," said the
young prince. "No man is really great who has not
developed a woman's tenderness in his heart, and
that our fellows may know that we have this quality,
we wear skirts and robes."</p>

<p>This is why in our day the king and priest
and judge wear long gowns. The king rules men,
women and children alike; the judge administers
the law for all of them, and the minister prays for
the good as well as the bad. For this reason we
should respect their robes when we see them.</p>

<p>The natives did not know the name of the
young prince but when they saw him take a piece
of mica and hold it over a bit of cotton until the sun
set it on fire, they exclaimed "Zamna!" meaning
"Eye of the Sun," and this was what they called
him while he lived in that country. The wise men
had placed some copal on top of the altar they had
made of wood and stone and it was not long before
the cotton and copal began to burn. As it did so,
the Golden Hearted pointed with his finger to a ray
of the midday sun. First he and his followers held
their arms high overhead, then they sat in a squatting
position and recited all the incidents of their
journey. Finally they all prostrated themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
on the ground and returned thanks for their safety
and good health. Rising to their feet, the wise
men began to chant with bared heads and faces
turned toward the east.</p>

<p>The natives thought this a very strange performance
and debated among themselves whether
it could be part of the Good Law they were soon
to learn.</p>

<p>"Do you come to destroy our old faiths, and
to bring us a new god?" they asked as the wood
on the altar burned low and the chanting ceased.</p>

<p>"To attack any form of worship is like fighting
darkness with a stick. The only way to overcome
the blackness of night dwelling in men's
hearts is to kindle a light&mdash;and the light of the
world is love," responded the Golden Hearted as
he slipped his arm through that of the native who
had asked him the question. "I did not come to
quarrel with you. I want you to think of me as a
brother ready and willing to serve you always. In
my father's kingdom, the man who serves faithfully
in any capacity is the one most honored. Take this
cross to the chief of your village and say to him
that He who is the Dew of Heaven, Lord of the
Dawn, and of the Four Winds, sends his only son
with a message of peace and good will to all his
people. Show him the red hand painted in the
center and tell him that it is not meant to convey
strength, power and mastery, but that it is raised
thus as an act of supplication."</p>

<p>As the swiftest courier in the group was girding
a red sash tightly around his waist making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
ready for a quick run, the fishermen came up from
their huts and invited the travelers to come and
share their humble noonday meal. The Golden
Hearted was glad to accept the extended hospitality,
not because he had no provisions of his own,
but because he valued their good opinion and was
ready to do whatever he thought would please
them.</p>

<p>They were a gentle, kindly folk, these simple
fishermen. Not only were they industrious, but
they were polite and reverential to their superiors
and as happy as a lot of children when they found
the strange prince under their roof. In all the
after years they would have been willing to die for
him.</p>

<p>The wise men of his company were so strict in
their habits that they refused to eat the flesh of any
animal, and their simple meal was soon finished.
But while every one else was at the table they performed
a sacred dance in a pompous and solemn
style, circling around the Golden Hearted who sat
by himself. They had green palms in their hands
and every once in a while they would bow to the
prince. In a peculiar sing-song way they chanted
a long poem telling about the history of the Happy
Island.</p>

<p>Imagine how funny they must have looked
whirling round and round with their long robes,
black veils and wide sleeves filled with the wind.
They kept on their high hats and with their long
beards and hair flying in every direction, it was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
wonder that the fishermen and other people
laughed and thought it was some kind of game.
The dancers were not at all offended, and when
the natives asked if they knew how to play ball,
they answered good naturedly:</p>

<p>"No, but we would like very much to learn."</p>

<p>"Come out here into the alley and we will
teach you. By and by you may give us lessons in
many things, but we are going to give you the
first one."</p>

<p>Then they all laughed, and so did the young
prince and the wise old men.</p>

<p>The alley where they played ball was one hundred
feet long and had smooth, white-washed walls
about twelve feet high in the center, but lower at
each end where there was a rectangular nook for
the players to rest. The walls were quite thick at
the base but tapered toward the top which was
finished with battlements and turrets.</p>

<p>Before the game began, the oldest player
among them threw the small, solid, India-rubber
ball four times around the alley muttering some
words to himself all the time. The owner of the
ground made the old man a trifling present, and
then the game began in good earnest.</p>

<p>The rule was to hit the ball only with the knee,
elbow or shoulder, not with the hands nor feet. The
wise men with their long gowns and veils had a
hard time keeping up with the native players, who
wore very little clothing and were quick and sure
footed. Two on each side played at a time, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
the great point was to send the ball against the
opposite wall or else over it as often as possible
without allowing it to touch the ground. There
were two referees; one being the Golden Hearted
and the other, the oldest player.</p>

<p>Everybody shouted and laughed at the clumsy
playing of the wise men who tried ever so hard to
imitate the things they saw the others doing. It was
a great effort for them and they panted and blowed
as they ran. Very often they tumbled heels over
head by stepping on their skirts in front. Then
they would all go down together in a heap, one on
top of the other, and the referees would have much
to do before they could get them all straightened
out again. It was jolly good fun, but required considerable
time and patience even for an expert
player to send the ball over the wall with either his
elbow, knee or shoulder.</p>

<p>In the center of the wall on each side was a
huge stone carved with images, having a hole in
the center barely big enough for the ball to go
through. Whoever was skilful enough to make a
drive through one of them, not only won the game
for his side, but was entitled to the cloaks of all
those present. Of course, this was a very difficult
feat to accomplish and made quite a hero of the
man who succeeded, so every player tried for the
honor.</p>

<p>This day the young native who first hailed the
Golden Hearted when he landed, by a lucky toss of
the elbow sent the ball flying through the hole on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
the wise men's side. In a moment the spectators
scrambled down from their seats and ran away as
fast as they could go. The wise men stood looking
after them in wide-eyed astonishment, and before
they had time to get out of the alley the victor
stripped them of their veils and then their tall hats
looked like a piece of stove pipe with a cover over
one end of it.</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted insisted that each man
should give back whatever he had won in a bet on
the game, and for each loss of this kind he gave
both winner and loser a present, and promised to
teach their sons and daughters how to weave cloth
having figures in it. In such a way he taught them
how to count, and to this day they have no other
method of reproducing a pattern perfectly. Each
stitch must be counted and only a certain number
of each color put in, and all this must be carried in
the head. The weavers are not allowed to write it
down.</p>

<p>At nightfall the runners came in breathless
with haste to say that the chief of the village was
sending a councilor and official guide to welcome
and escort the strange white men to his dwelling.
But the Golden Hearted was not in a hurry to leave
the fishermen and common people with whom he
had spent the day, except for a short visit. When
he returned he taught them how to make sun-dried
bricks with which to build houses, also to shape the
round water jars of brown pottery and how to
ornament them and the gourds they drank from.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
The wise men assisted him in all this, and in time,
the natives not only built comfortable houses for
themselves but learned how to fashion many pretty
designs of cornices and wall decorations out of
stucco which they tinted many colors.</p>

<p>The first thing he did when he went to the village
was to make the chief king, and then he
ordered some of the wise men who were architects
and engineers to lay out a splendid city and help
the natives to build it. Before he came there were
nothing but trails from one part of the country to
the other and the simple tradesmen did not know
how to exchange their wares. The Golden Hearted
became the patron of the builders and traders and
lived many years with the people of Aztlan.</p>

<p>While in that country, he occupied himself with
the building of a sacred temple dedicated to those
who served the Good Law. It had four beautiful
halls facing the four cardinal points of the compass.
That on the east was the Hall of Gold and
its walls were almost covered with plates of the
precious metal having delicately-chased pictures
over its shining surface. To the west was the Hall
of Emeralds and Turquoises where many gems
were studded into the plaster. The south hall was
finished in silver while the northern hall was made
of jasper stuck with colored shells in curious patterns.
In each room there was a tapestry of yellow,
blue, white and red feather mosaic that was as fine
as a painting and in some cases perfectly represented
men and animals. In front of the main
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
entrance for many years stood a winged lion cut out
of granite holding an image of the Golden Hearted
in his mouth.</p>

<p>The name of the city was Mayapan and the
king who had been merely a village chief was the
celebrated Cocomes of the olden times.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ONE evening the Golden Hearted
saw a ball of fire rise in the
East just about where the
Happy Island was located,
and it followed the course of
the sun. Then he knew it was
time for him to take some of
the wise men and go into a
new place, so he lay awake
long into the night and
thought how best to begin to get ready. He
knew the people loved him very much, but he
remembered his oath to his father, the king, and
though he was sad at heart, he determined to leave
the next day but one. He had not yet spoken to
anybody about his intention, but it must have been
right else it would not have happened that a whole
lot more wise men came to the city that very day.</p>

<p>"Now," he said to himself, "I can leave these
wise men to help the poor natives, and I will take
seven of their families with me."</p>

<p>Seeing that it was daybreak and the sun about
to rise, the Golden Hearted sprang out of bed and
hastily washing his face and hands, threw the window
wide open and lifting his arms high overhead
said:</p>

<p>"Hail! Beauty of the Day! Homage to thee
who riseth above the horizon. I come near to thee.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Thou openest the gates of another day. Great
Illuminator out of the golden, place thyself as a
protector behind me. Guide and keep me safe on
the journey that I am about to undertake."</p>

<p>Then he dressed himself as quickly as possible
and went out to find the wise men and tell them
what he was going to do. They were willing to
go with him, but King Cocomes was greatly disappointed,
though he felt more contented when the
Golden Hearted promised to come back again.</p>

<p>"Quiet thy heart, great king, and trust in my
love," was what the young prince said to him.</p>

<p>The travelers had to pass through the country
of the Quinames who were a very wild people. They
went about naked with long matted hair hanging
over their shoulders, and they ate raw meat, fruits
and herbs. They knew nothing about cooking, but
could make pulque, a kind of beer, out of maguey
plant, a cousin of the cactus family. On this they
often got very drunk. Then they were fierce and
quarrelsome. At all times these people were proud
of their strength and cunning in battle and in
hunting the ferocious beasts roaming over the hills
and plains. The Quinames were really a dreadful
set of men, but the Golden Hearted was not afraid
of them. He heard all kinds of stories about their
cruelty and savage ways of living, but he went
quietly among them and parceled out the land and
showed them how to cultivate it. The Quinames
lived entirely by hunting and fishing and had no
houses. When one place did not suit them any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
longer, they moved to another, and would never
have learned how to live civilized except for the
coming of the prince and the wise men.</p>

<p>And what a terrible journey it was! It was
in a tropic country where there was so much warm
rain that everything grew rank and luxuriant. For
whole days the Golden Hearted marched in the
shadow of ferns as big as trees and the ground
was covered with briers and nettles. Sometimes
he had to go around muddy swamps or right
through bushes filled with snakes. Then, too, he
had to swim across wide rivers and climb steep,
rocky mountains. In the tangled leaves and vines
hundreds of parrots screamed and screeched at
them, while on all sides the monkeys threw sticks
from the branches of the trees. Gnats and other
poisonous insects stung his hands and face.</p>

<p>He traveled like this many days. Whenever
he went into camp, the Golden Hearted would
invite the Quinames to dine with him in order that
he might teach them how to eat cooked food out
of dishes. They could not understand the use of
cups and basins, because they drank out of cocoa-nut
shells and had never seen a napkin or tablecloth.
They had always been in the habit of taking
the food in their fingers and pulling it apart, and
were not very nice about keeping their hands clean
either.</p>

<p>Of course, all this was very disagreeable to the
Golden Hearted, but he was as patient and kind as
possible and those fierce Quinames would not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
harmed a hair in his head. When they asked him
where he was going he always answered, "To seek
my brothers, the Culebra, of whom thou shalt know
more by and by."</p>

<p>"And from where comest thou?"</p>

<p>"From the mountain of Little Descent, and
where I tarry, there will I build Nachan, the city
of Serpents."</p>

<p>The ignorant barbarians did not know that
the word serpent meant wisdom in the language of
the Happy Island, but the wise men were much
pleased because they knew that this city was to be
a great seat of learning and that they would have
charge of the temples and schools when it was
completed.</p>

<p>"Who art thou and thy followers?" was often
asked of them on the way.</p>

<p>"We are Chanes and the sons of Chanes," but
this did not mean anything to the savages either,
because they did not know that "Chane" was the
name of the wise men in their own country.</p>

<p>One day a culprit was brought before the
Golden Hearted accused of stealing a curious looking
stick with yellow grains fastened all around it.
The Quinames said it was good food and they
pulled off its green wrappings and held it before
the fire until it was browned and then ate it. The
Golden Hearted and the wise men had never seen
this plant before and were very much interested in
their discovery. But they did not think it well to
say so.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>"Dost thou say this man is a thief?" asked
the Golden Hearted.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; we knew where the bush grew, but
we were waiting until it should be more yellow
before giving it to thee," said the captors.</p>

<p>"I will prove thee," said the Golden Hearted
to the accused. He took a piece of finely-polished
black stone from his breast pocket and held it up
before the prisoner saying, "Look into its shining
face and beholding thine own image, swear by the
Heart of Heaven to speak the truth."</p>

<p>The poor savage nearly died of fright when
he saw himself because he thought it was an omen
of instant death. He quaked and trembled and his
eyes were as big and round as walnuts.</p>

<p>"From whence came this goodly seed?" asked
the Golden Hearted kindly.</p>

<p>"From the edge of the wood where a silver
band of water rots an old tree," answered the man,
still pallid with fear.</p>

<p>"Take thy share, and leave me what thy accusers
intended for me."</p>

<p>The prisoner stared at him stupidly for a
moment then his better nature spoke and he took
only one grain, and would have fled into the jungle
if the Golden Hearted had not caught him by the
mantle.</p>

<p>"Look again into the mirror of truth."</p>

<p>This time the savage was not so afraid and he
gazed curiously at the stone for some time. Its surface
was perfectly blank.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me what thou seest?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but its own dark face speaks to the
eye of thy servant," responded the accused.</p>

<p>"Then know, my brothers," said the Golden
Hearted turning to the astonished Quinames, "this
man is innocent and must go free."</p>

<p>"Thou art welcome to my life," exclaimed the
accused joyfully; "thou hast saved it and it is thine
to command."</p>

<p>"Use it to perfect the growth of this strange
seed so that thy fellows and all grain-eating creatures
may profit by thy labors."</p>

<p>The grain found in this manner is known to
the people of that country to-day as maize. We
call it Indian corn.</p>

<p>When the wise men heard about it, they begged
the Golden Hearted to let them build a white
house where any one accused of crime would be
safe until the judges could decide whether they
were guilty or not. The prince thought it was a
very good plan and said:</p>

<p>"I will put the black stone in it and will make
a law that no man shall be called guilty if the surface
of the stone does not change when he is made
to look into it. And to commemorate our safe
passage through this wild country, I will order
several white houses built, and each one shall be
called Refuges Against Fear."</p>

<p>In those days no one seemed to think it was
wrong to kill a person who was said to be a
thief or had done anything his neighbors did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
like, so it was very necessary for the Golden
Hearted to teach them to be just to each other. He
told the Quinames that they must be sure about a
thing before they acted harshly, and he cautioned
them to be careful about believing or repeating
unkind remarks they heard. It was quite a long
time before the Quinames would even try to do this,
but finally they helped to build the houses and
were honorable enough not to harm any one once
inside the walls. Many a useful life was saved in
this manner, but sometimes a poor refugee was
overtaken and beaten to death with clubs before
reaching the house.</p>

<p>Because the Golden Hearted succeeded in persuading
the warlike Quinames to live peaceably
with their neighbors and to treat each other well,
he was called in that and many other countries,
Votan, The People's Heart, to distinguish him
from the Heart of Heaven which was their name
for God. His was truly a great work because it
was done without a selfish motive and for no
reward except the good of his fellow men.</p>

<h2>Lord of the Sacred Tunkel</h2>

<div>
<img  class="drop-cap" src="images/i_038.jpg" style="margin-top:-6em" width="108" height="352" alt="N" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">NO one living can tell how many
years ago it was that the Golden
Hearted built Nachan, the city
of wise men, nor how many years
it took to do the work, but it has
always been said to be a very
beautiful place. Anyhow, it was
after he left the Quinames, and it was
in a country very much more civilized.</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted had many
happy days there.</p>

<p>Even if he was a grown man and a
great prince, he was very fond of
children and one day he visited the
Temple of the Sun where the pupils from
school were having a holiday. They all
had on their best clothes, and their faces
and hands were clean, but they were
shouting, and singing and playing games, very
much like the boys and girls we know. They
felt sure that the Golden Hearted was their good
friend and when they saw him coming they ran
out into the courtyard and crowded around him
as thick as flies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>"A story! a story!" they said; "Please, good
Prince, tell us a story."</p>

<p>"What shall it be about?" asked the Golden
Hearted with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>"Something very perfect and beautiful," they
said.</p>

<p>"Let me think what we have in the world that
is both perfect and beautiful. Which would you
prefer, something man has made, or that God has
made?"</p>

<p>The children were very much puzzled to know
which to choose. They tried hard to think what
man had made that was without any faults and
could not be imitated or improved, either in
appearance or quality, but they were not satisfied
with anything. Then they began to think about
the trees, the flowers, the precious stones, the sky
and the sea, and were getting more and more confused
all the time when the Golden Hearted
laughed and said:</p>

<p>"I will tell you what we will do. We will
send for the wise men and ask them to choose."</p>

<p>The wise men thought it was great fun, so
they hurried as fast as they could and were quite
out of breath when they got near enough to speak
to the Golden Hearted.</p>

<p>"Tell me something you know in the world
that is both perfect and beautiful," he said to the
wise man who had charge of the Temple of the
Sun, and was first to arrive.</p>

<p>"The great, blazing, glorious sun," he replied.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>"None but God could have made it, and we adore
it and sacrifice to it because it is the mask behind
which God hides His ever-smiling face."</p>

<p>Many of the children shaded their eyes with
their hands and took a quick look at the sun overhead,
and thought that was a good answer.</p>

<p>"What do you know in the world that is both
perfect and beautiful?" asked the prince of the
next comer, who was a man wise in the art of working
metals. He had not heard the first answer,
but, without stopping a minute to think, said:</p>

<p>"Gold; because it is like the substance of the
sun and cannot be made by putting any metals
together nor by any mixture of chemicals."</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted knew that was a correct
answer but he wanted the children to be satisfied,
and he was not sure that all of them understood
it.</p>

<p>"Do you know that way down in the earth
gold is created, and yet it is shining and bright
and yellow like the light of the sun? This accounts
for its beauty, and it is perfect because it is absolutely
pure in itself."</p>

<p>The next man that came along was wise, but he
looked like a farmer.</p>

<p>"What have you seen in your life that cannot
be improved or made prettier?"</p>

<p>"Wheat," was his quick reply, "because it
is not a blend of any of the grains or grasses but
grows out of the ground perfect. It is beautiful in
every phase of its life whether it waves in the wind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
like a sea of emeralds or ripens into great sheaves
of gold, or its plump grains tempt you to satisfy
hunger. It is the best friend man has, and it would
be very hard for him to live without it."</p>

<p>That was such a sensible answer, that the
children all clapped their hands with delight
because they knew at once that it was correct. Just
then the Golden Hearted looked up and saw one
of his best perfumers in the group of wise men.</p>

<p>"Will you give us an answer to this question?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I should differ from all the others"&mdash;began
the man.</p>

<p>"Never mind, tell us what in your line is the
most perfect and beautiful thing you know."</p>

<p>"A jasmine blossom," replied the perfumer,
"because its delicate odor cannot be imitated no
matter what combination of oils or extracts we
make. I cannot say that of any other flower in the
world."</p>

<p>The children could have answered that question
themselves if they had only thought quickly
enough. They were quite familiar with the dainty
little white flowers and tender vine of the jasmine
as well as its sweet smell, because it grew wild in
their country.</p>

<p>While the perfumer was talking, the Golden
Hearted picked up a shining pebble near his feet.</p>

<p>"Now, children," he said, "in this small
rough stone I find something perfect and beautiful.
It is an opal, the only one of the precious gems I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
do not know how to counterfeit. Join hands, as
many of you as can, and dance around me while
I sing you a song about the birth of the opal."</p>

<p>One
of the wise men gave him a Sacred Tunkel, a kind
of guitar which he brought from the Temple of
the Sun, and this was what he sang:</p>

<p class="center">The Birth of the Opal</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>A dew drop came with a spark of flame</p>
<p class="i1">He had caught from the sun's last rays</p>
<p>To a violet's breast, where he lay at rest</p>
<p class="i1">Till the hours brought back the day.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>The rose looked down with a blush and a frown</p>
<p class="i1">But she smiled all at once to view</p>
<p>Her own bright form with its coloring warm</p>
<p class="i1">Reflected back by the dew.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then the stranger took a stolen look</p>
<p class="i1">At the sky so soft and blue,</p>
<p>And a leaflet green with its silver sheen</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>A cold north wind, as he thus reclined,</p>
<p class="i1">Of a sudden raged around,</p>
<p>And a maiden fair, who was walking there</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Some of the pupils were inclined to think that
the singing of the Golden Hearted was the most
perfect and beautiful they had ever heard and they
all liked to listen to the low plaintive notes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Tunkel. Those that could not take part in the
dance gathered around their teachers and asked:</p>

<p>"What shall we do to honor the good prince
and show him how much we appreciate his efforts
to amuse and please us?"</p>

<p>"Ask him to allow you to answer your own
question," they said, "and then tell him something
about your feathered friends. Have you forgotten
the hermit of the woods with its rainbow
plumes three feet long and its gay scarlet breast?"</p>

<p>The name of this bird is the Quetzal, and it
lives on the high mountain tops all alone and is
only about the size of a pigeon.</p>

<p>When the Golden Hearted finished singing
and the dancers were all standing still, a bright-faced
boy approached and said, "We have an
answer to our own question, good prince."</p>

<p>"Say on, my little man, I am listening to
you."</p>

<p>"It is the Quetzal, the rarest bird in the world,
and the most perfect and beautiful of all feathered
creatures. With its brilliant luster plumes
I crown you Lord of the Sacred Tunkel, as a
reward for your sweet singing. May the children
of every land know and love you as we do."</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted was much surprised and
pleased with his new crown and ever after wore
the feathers of the Quetzal in his head dress. So
long as he remained in Nachan, he was called the
Lord of the Sacred Tunkel because he could play
so well upon this queerly-shaped guitar.

<h2>The Stars' Ball</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_044.jpg" width="132" height="122" alt="I" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT was not so very long after the
children had crowned him Lord
of the Sacred Tunkel until the
Golden Hearted planned to have
them all with him again. He
made up his mind to spend his
lifetime teaching because he
thought that was the most
useful thing he could do, but he was determined
to make the lessons for the children as pleasant
as possible. He and the wise men taught the
older people how to divide the days into weeks,
months and years, and how to make a calendar, and
all about the sun and the moon and the stars, but
this was too hard for the children. So he decided
to take them up on the roof of the Temple of the
Sun in the moonlight and tell them some simple
pretty story about the sky at night.</p>

<p>In that country, the houses were built with
flat roofs covered with red tiles, and there was
either a ladder or a winding staircase from the
ground, so it was not much trouble to get up on
the roof. In fact, many of the dwellings had
beautiful potted plants up there, and it was really
a pleasant place to go of a warm summer evening.
This night there was not a breath of air, and
the children did not need anything on their heads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
nor any wraps. Only around the lower edges of
the sky were there clouds and these were soft and
white like big piles of cotton. The whole heavens
looked like a bright blue veil thickly sprinkled
with diamonds. It was very still and quiet and
there were so many flowers in bloom that the very
atmosphere was fragrant with them. In the mill
pond close by the frogs croaked, and around the
eaves of the houses the crickets and katydids were
singing an evening hymn.</p>

<p>It was just a lovely night to go out and nearly
every one was in the street. The doors and windows
were wide open, and the people went about
bareheaded and laughed and chatted to their
heart's content.</p>

<p>"The goodness of this perfect night be upon
my little friends," said the prince, when he came
up on the roof of the Temple and found a lot of
children he knew. "I have invited you to witness
the stars' ball to-night, but before we begin, I must
introduce you to the most prominent ones."</p>

<p>Then he pointed out the milky way with its
millions of stars that looked like little pin heads
in a band of light because they were so far away.
Below the handle of the big dipper, and off to one
side was the north star. Jupiter with his broad
dark bands and tiny moons was there, and so was
Saturn with his three rings. Over in another place
was Mars twinkling and batting his eyes as if he
wanted to fight something. The Dog Star was
still lower down and quite by himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>"I will first make you acquainted with the
big-faced, silver moon," said the prince. "She
is sailing along as if she were in a great hurry,
but there will be time enough for you to see the
man up there if you look sharp about it."</p>

<p>The children knew there was not a surely man
in the moon so they all laughed and clapped their
hands and then threw kisses at the beautiful queen
of the night.</p>

<p>"I cannot show you Mercury, the messenger
of the sun, because he is such a sleepy head he has
already gone to bed. He never stays up long after
the sun goes down, but he is an industrious little
fellow and often gets up first in the morning."</p>

<p>The children thought that was a very funny
way to speak of a star, but they saw the prince was
in a good humor and they enjoyed listening to
what he said.</p>

<p>"Venus is our evening star," he continued,
pointing to the brightest object in the western sky,
"and she is winking and smiling at us. Look
closely now, and see if you can find her."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig48" id="fig48"></a>
<img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="344" height="459" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"AN OLD-FASHIONED ALMANAC"</p>
</div>

<p>When all the children had seen her, the Golden
Hearted turned to another part of the heavens and
said, "Here is old Father Time, who frowns and
scowls, and finally grinds the life out of our
bodies." He was speaking about Saturn because
it rolls and tumbles one way while its three rings
whirl around the other way, and all the people in
olden times believed that the stars could give good
or bad luck and could make our lives long or short.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
There were a number of this kind of fortune tellers
among the wise men, so of course the prince knew
what they thought about the stars. The children
understood it too, and when he pointed out Saturn,
they said to each other in a whisper, "It is the
death star; let us hope it will not shine upon us nor
upon those we love."</p>

<p>"If we have need to fear the Master of Time,
we have every reason to love the broad-belted
planet with its sturdy little companions. It has
been rightly named 'The Beneficent,'" said the
prince&mdash;indicating the position of Jupiter among
the stars. "Its children pop in and out behind it
as if they were playing hide and seek."</p>

<p>For ages people thought that Jupiter gave
them good luck and made them wise, tender and
kind. This is why the children said, "The big,
white, shining star has a heart like our prince."</p>

<p>Mars is the nearest planet to us, and he sputters
and fumes as if he really had as bad a temper
as these people credited him with. All the wars and
troubles they had came from him, they said, and
the children did not care to look at him very long.
He gives out a beautiful red light, while Jupiter
is bluish white, and the Dog Star has all colors
like the rainbow.</p>

<p>"Now," said the prince, "I will show you
the most important group in the sky. It is the
Pleiades, directly over our heads at this time. There
are seven of these sisters, and the pale, dim one is
the center of the whole system of stars because all
the rest of them circle around her."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>Then he explained to them how each star and
planet, as well as the earth, turns over and over of
its own accord, besides going around the sun in
a very wide circle. All the stars are wonderful
tumblers and they spin around just like tops, and
this whirling motion was what made the prince say
that they were having a ball. When they twinkled
and sparkled, he said they were dancing.</p>

<p>As soon as he sat down, one of the children
got the Sacred Tunkel, and then some took
hold of his hands, others held on to his mantle and
still others put their arms around his neck and
begged him to sing for them. He did not wish to
refuse them, but he did not know any song suitable
for the occasion so he made this up as he went
along:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh! the stars one and all</p>
<p>They had a great ball</p>
<p class="i1">One night way up in the sky;</p>

<p>To join in their mirth</p>
<p class="i1">But it feared to go up so high.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>No fiddler had they</p>
<p>Their music to play,</p>

<p class="i1">And the comet kept time with his tail.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>They danced and they danced,</p>
<p>And they pranced and they pranced,</p>
<p class="i1">Till the moon said 'twas all he desired,</p>

<p>He could whistle no more,</p>

<h2>The National Book</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_051.jpg" width="147" height="136" alt="B" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">BECAUSE it is possible for persons
to do both good and evil in their
lives, and to think good and bad
thoughts, the wise men and the
Golden Hearted studied how to
keep these ideas before the
people all the time. In those
days, the natives of that country
had no books and no way of
writing and it was necessary to select some
familiar object to represent the meaning of many
things. Whatever is used for such a purpose, is
called a symbol.</p>

<p>The hippopotamus, the crocodile and the tapir
are to this day said to be symbols of humanity
because they have two natures. They can live in the
water or on the land, and search for food either in
the day or night time. Of the three animals, the
wise men selected the tapir because it is a shy, inoffensive
creature, not much larger than a sheep and
lives on green grasses and herbs. During the day
it sleeps quietly in the water or on the bank of a
stream and at night comes on land to get food.
When its coat is dry, it is of a dark brown color,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
but when wet, it is black and shining. A tapir
looks very much like a fat donkey except that its
ears are not so long and its nose not quite so
stumpy. At Nachan the wise men raised great
herds of them as an example and illustration of
our good and bad self.</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted realized that he must do
more than found a large city and teach the children,
so he had a Dark House built away under
ground where he could store treasures and all the
records of his journey. This was a secret passageway,
and in its halls and labyrinths he had quantities
of statuary and pottery put for safe keeping.
While this was being done, he wrote a book called
in his language "The Popol Vuh" but we would
say it is a national book because it tells all about
the beginning of the world and is divided into
four parts. It is a most singular story, and has
been translated so we can read it for ourselves. It
is said to be the oldest book in America, and the
Golden Hearted kept an order of wise men in the
Dark House underground to guard it from one
generation to another.</p>

<p class="center p2">The Popul Vuh</p>

<p>This is the beginning of the history of things
which came to pass long ago; of the division of the
earth, the property of all; its origin and its foundation,
as well as the narrative of our life in the
land of shadows, and of how we saw the light. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
is the first book written in the olden times, but its
view is hidden from him who sees and thinks.</p>

<p>Behold the first word and the first discourse.
There was as yet no man, nor any animal, nor
bird, nor fish, nor crawfish, nor any pit, nor any
ravine, nor green herb, nor any tree.</p>

<p>Nothing was but the firmament.</p>

<p>The face of the earth had not yet appeared&mdash;only
the peaceful sea and all the space of heaven.
There was nothing yet joined together, nothing
that clung to anything else; nothing that balanced
itself, that made the least rustling, that made a
sound in the heaven. There was nothing that stood
up; nothing but silence and darkness and night
time.</p>

<p>Alone were those that engender, those that
give being; they were upon the waters like a growing
light. They consulted together and meditated;
they mingled their words and their opinions.</p>

<p>"Earth!" they said, and on the instant it was
formed; like a cloud of fog was its beginning.</p>

<p>Then the mountains rose over the water like
great lobsters. In an instant the mountains and
plains were visible and the cypress and the pine
trees appeared.</p>

<p>The Heart of Heaven cried out and said:</p>

<p>"Blessed be thy coming. Our work and our
labor has accomplished its end."</p>

<p>The earth and its vegetation having appeared,
it was peopled with the various forms of animal
life. And the makers said to the animals, "Speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
now our name. Honor Him who begets and Him
who gives being. Speak, call on us, salute us."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig55" id="fig55"></a>

<p class="caption">"BEHOLD THE FIRST WORD"<br />
See <a href="#Page_54">opposite page</a></p>
</div>

<p>But the animals could not answer. They
could only cluck and croak, each murmuring after
its kind in a different manner.</p>

<p>This displeased the creators, and they said
to the animals:</p>

<p>"Inasmuch as ye cannot praise us, neither
call upon our names, your flesh shall be humiliated.
It shall be broken with teeth. Ye shall be killed
and eaten."</p>

<p>The first man was made of clay, but he was
watery, had no strength and could not turn his
head. His face looked one way all the time. He
was given a language, but he had no intelligence,
so he was consumed in water.</p>

<p>"Let us make an intelligent being who shall
adore and invoke us," said the Thunderbolt and
the Lightning Flash.</p>

<p>It was decided that a man should be made
of wood and a woman of a kind of pith. They were
made but the result was in no wise satisfactory.
They moved about perfectly well it is true; they
increased and multiplied and peopled the world
with little wooden manikins like themselves, but
the heart and intelligence were wanting. They had
no memory of their Maker; they lived like the
beasts and forgot the Heart of Heaven. They had
neither blood nor substance, nor moisture nor fat.
Their cheeks were shriveled; their feet and hands
dried up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>Then was the Heart of Heaven very wroth,
and he sent ruin and destruction upon these
ingrates. He rained upon them night and day with
a thick resin and the earth was all dark.</p>

<p>The men went mad with terror. They tried
to mount up on the roofs, but the houses fell with
them. They tried to climb the trees, but the trees
shook them from their branches. They tried to
hide in the caves and dens of the earth, but these
closed against them.</p>

<p>Then their heads were cut off, and their bones
broken and bruised, and their eyes picked out by
the birds, and their flesh eaten by wild beasts.</p>

<p>Thus were they all devoted to chastisement
and destruction save only a few who were preserved
as memorials of the wooden men. These
now exist in the forests as little apes.</p>

<p>In the night the gods counseled together again.
"Of what shall we make man?" they said.</p>

<p>Then the Creator made four perfect men out
of white and yellow corn. The name of the first
one was The Tiger With the Sweet Smile, the second
one was called The Tiger of the Night, the
third one was The Distinguished Name, and the
fourth was The Tiger of the Moon. They had
neither father nor mother, but their coming into
existence was a miracle wrought by the special
intervention of Him who is pre-eminently the
Creator.</p>

<p>At last were there found men worthy of their
origin and their destiny. Verily the gods looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
on beings who could see with their eyes and handle
with their hands and understand with their hearts.
Grand of countenance and broad of limb, the four
sires of our race stood up under the white rays of
the morning star.</p>

<p>Their great, clear eyes swept rapidly over all.
They saw the woods, the rocks, the lakes and the
sea; the mountains and the valleys, and they gazed
up into heaven not knowing what they had come so
far to do. Their hearts were filled with love, obedience
and fear. Lifting up their eyes, they returned
thanks saying:</p>

<p>"Hail! O Creator, Thou that lovest and
understandest us! We offer up our thanks. We
have been created&mdash;abandon us not, forsake us not!
Give us descendants and a posterity as long as the
light endures. Give us to walk always in an open
wood in a path without snares; to lead quiet lives
free of all reproach."</p>

<p>But the Gods were not wholly pleased with
this thing. Heaven, they thought, had overshot its
mark. These men were too perfect; knew, understood
and saw too much.</p>

<p>"What shall we do with man now?" they said.
"This that we see is not good. Let us contract
man's sight so he may see only a little of the surface
of the earth and be content."</p>

<p>Thereupon, the Heart of Heaven breathed a
cloud over the pupils of the eyes of the men, and
a veil came over each eye as when one breathes on
the face of a mirror. Thus was the globe of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
eye darkened, nor was that which was far off clear
to it any more.</p>

<p>Then they fell asleep and when they woke
up, the gods had brought each one of them a wife.
They lived tranquilly together for a long time
waiting for the rising of the sun, because they had
nothing but the morning star for a light.</p>

<p>But no sun came, and the four men and their
families grew uneasy.</p>

<p>"We have no one to watch over us, no one to
guard our symbols," they said. So they all set
out for the Seven Caves.</p>

<p>Poor wanderers. They had a cruel way to go,
many forests to penetrate, many high mountains
to climb, and a long passage to make through the
sea. Much hail and cold rain fell on their heads,
and when their fires all went out they suffered from
hunger as well as cold.</p>

<p>At last they came to a mountain and here they
rested. While there they were told that the sun
was coming very soon. Then they shook their
incense pans and danced for very gladness. As the
sun commenced to advance, the animals, great and
small, were filled with delight. They raised themselves
to the surface of the waters, they fluttered
in the ravines, and gathering at the edge of the
mountains, turned their heads together toward that
part from which the sun came.</p>

<p>The lion and the tiger roared, and the first
bird that sang was the Quetzal. All the animals
were beside themselves at the sight. The eagle and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
the kite beat their wings, and the men prostrated
themselves on the ground.</p>

<p>The sun and the moon and the stars were all
established. Yet was not the sun the same as now.
His heat wanted force, and he was but as a reflection
in a mirror. Nevertheless he dried up and
warmed the surface of the earth and answered
many good ends.</p>

<p>There was another wonder when the sun rose.
The tribal gods who had punished these poor people
so were turned into stone. And so were all
the mammoth lions, tigers, vipers, and other fierce
and dangerous animals.</p>

<h2>Manco-Capac, the Powerful One</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_060.jpg" width="95" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">
IT is time for us to go away from
this place," said the wise men to
the Golden Hearted one day when
they were finishing the Dark House,
where they were going to leave the
National Book.</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?" asked
the prince, laying down an axe made of copper and
tin which he was sharpening for one of the
workmen.</p>

<p>"Because we have yet to find the spot where
the gold wedge your father, the king, gave you will
sink into the earth of its own accord."</p>

<p>"That is to be in the Place of Gold, and among
the Children of the Sun."</p>

<p>"Yes; and we are not far from the country
known as the "Four Quarters of the World" where
they live. We must go to them at once, and there
we will build Cuzco, and make it the navel or center
of all their possessions. Under the name of Manco-Capac,
the powerful one, you will be the first Inca
or ruler, and your banner will be a rainbow, to
show that you serve the Children of the Sun."</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted did not wish to become
a ruler but he did not see how he could refuse obedience
to the faithful old wise men, so he said:</p>

<p>"I will go with you and do as you say, but tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
me how you intend to build this wonderful city of
Cuzco?"</p>

<p>"You must not feel that we compel you to
go," said the wise men, looking ready to cry,
because they thought the young prince was not
pleased with them. "It was your father's command,
and our promise to him."</p>

<p>"I know that," said the prince impatiently,
"but how are you going to make Cuzco the center
of everything?"</p>

<p>"By building the streets on the four points of
the compass, and by connecting it with royal roadways
to the four corners of the kingdom. We shall
have no trouble doing so, for our reports say that
the natives are mild and gentle, and that there are
stones in that country as broad and long as a
room."</p>

<p>When he and the wise men started to make
the journey over the mountains, they put all of
their belongings on the backs of the llamas&mdash;a kind
of little camel not much larger than a sheep and
which is used in that country to-day for pack
animals, instead of burros or mules. They put the
load on the llama's back without any girt or pack
saddle, and its long, bushy wool holds all the things
in place. It has a sharp-pointed, horny toe like a
hook, which it fastens in the steep rocks, and then
it can climb over rough places without much
trouble. When a llama gets angry he does not
spit like an ordinary camel, but lies down like a
stubborn mule. No matter what you do to him, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
will not budge an inch, and then the load has to be
taken off, and he must be coaxed and fed before he
will go any farther.</p>

<p>One day the wise men and the Golden Hearted
came to a wide rocky chasm in the side of the mountain
hundreds of feet deep, having a swift-running
river at the bottom. There were so many sharp rocks
sticking up and the water dashed over them so fast
that it was all in a white foam, and nothing could
have swam across it. The native servants and
workmen did not know what to do.</p>

<p>"How are we to cross this deep canyon?" they
asked.</p>

<p>"We will help you make a suspension
bridge," said the wise men.</p>

<p>"But we have no tools"&mdash;they began.</p>

<p>"You have your two hands and some copper
axes and that is sufficient."</p>

<p>"We can fell trees and bring stones, but there
are not enough to span such a dangerous place,"
they said, still doubtful about the outcome.</p>

<p>"Take your axes and cut all the maguey you
can find," said the wise men. "Bring it here and
pile it up; then we will tell you what next to do."</p>

<p>The wise men and the Golden Hearted made
some heavy clubs out of the hard wood they
found growing near by. With these in a short time
they beat the maguey until its fibers fell apart
in coarse strands, which the sun dried. Then they
helped the natives braid it into heavy, thick ropes.
When they got enough of these made, they wove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
them together into a stout cable chain, long enough
to stretch across the river.</p>

<p>"What shall we do with the ends?" asked the
natives. "We cannot tie them to a tree."</p>

<p>"Certainly not, but you can gather big and
little stones for us," answered the wise men.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig64" id="fig64"></a>
<img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="340" height="310" alt="The Bridge" />
</div>

<p>With these they built immense buttresses on
the bank of the river, wide at the bottom and narrow
at the top so they would not tumble down nor
slip into the waters. Of course they had to leave
holes in the sides to fasten the cables into. It took
several strands to make the bridge wide enough,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
and even then the natives were afraid they would
fall into the water.</p>

<p>"We need a railing at each side," they said.</p>

<p>"Very well; make one out of the ropes," said
the wise men. When this was done the natives
were still unwilling to try to go across.</p>

<p>"We cannot take a single step. Our feet get
tangled in the meshes of the cable."</p>

<p>"Overcome this by making some rough boards
and laying them all the way over."</p>

<p>It was indeed a novel suspension bridge, for
when the planks were put onto the cable it sagged
in the middle and swayed forth and back in the
wind like a swing. Imagine how frightened the
natives must have been at first, but in that mountainous
country they never build any other kind of
bridges and they use them now all of the time.</p>

<p>"In this open stretch of valley and plain we
will plant sweet-smelling trees and shrubs by the
roadside so that travelers may be refreshed by the
shade and enjoy the perfume, and we will also
teach the Children of the Sun to build tambos or
post houses," said the Golden Hearted, when once
they were over the mountains. This they did at
every point where they stopped to rest, and at
each one they left a band of chasquis, or runners
in charge. The word chasqui means "one who
makes an exchange," and these men and boys not
only carried the news like our postmen and messengers,
but they traded news with each other and
with every one else they met. Before allowing
any of the runners to go out the Golden Hearted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
said: "I will make you keepers of the Quippos, or
knotted cords. The red ones mean war, or other
bad news, while the white ones are for peace and
prosperity. In the springtime if the crops are good,
you must carry bands of green cords. If you wish
to spread the reports of gold and silver use that
kind of quippo, so that the people seeing you far
off may know the import of your message. Count
them always by tens and twenties, and use diligence
and care to be accurate and quick in your
calculations."</p>

<p>This was a queer kind of arithmetic but it was
astonishing how soon the boys learned it. In after
years there were bands of strolling singers and
poets who went about the country, and they used
the quippos to recall the things they wanted to
remember, such as the brave deeds of their
ancestors and the names of their heroes. So long as
the inhabitants of this country were called Children
of the Sun, they had no other books and they
trained young men to be experts in reading them.
The language of the Quippos is said to be very
correct and elegant.</p>

<p>The first thing the Golden Hearted did when
he arrived at the end of his journey was to divide
the land into three parts&mdash;one for the sun, one for
the king and one for the people. Then he
appointed beautiful young girls to be Virgins of
the Sun and placed them in charge of elderly
women, who taught them how to spin and weave the
fine hair of the vicuna into hangings for the Place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
of Gold which the wise men had already commenced
to build. The girls knew how to embroider beautifully,
and it was a part of their duty to keep the
sacred fires always burning on the altar. The
Golden Hearted lighted the fire himself, and it
was kept burning night and day for hundreds of
years. In the Houses of the Virgins no man, not
even the king, could go, and if any one ever did, the
people not only killed him but tore down his house.
When they did anything of this kind they called
it "sowing the ground with stones," and ever
afterward his family and friends wore mourning
on account of the terrible disgrace.</p>

<p>The Place of Gold was a temple in the center
of Cuzco so named because the gold wedge sunk
immediately into the ground when it was tried, and
the wise men said it was appropriate because "gold
was the tears wept by the sun." It is said that no
building in the world was ever more beautiful than
this wonderful temple. The wise men and the
Golden Hearted did the best work they knew how,
and there was plenty of gold and precious stones
in the mountains, so they could use as much as they
liked. In front of the eastern entrance was a huge
sunburst made like a human face, with rays of
light starting out in every direction. Each ray was
thickly set with emeralds, and when the sun rose
in the morning, the reflection of the shining gold
and the sparkle of the emeralds lighted up the
whole temple. Besides this they had burnished
plates and cornices and vases and animals and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
flowers of gold all around the walls, and the water
urns and incense pans were also of the bright yellow
metal.</p>

<p>"We will celebrate a great festival of Rami;
the renewal time, when the sun is coaxing the earth
back to fertility; when the buds and leaves are
putting forth, and the birds are beginning to nest,"
said the Golden Hearted, as soon as the temple
was completed.</p>

<p>"Show the Children of the Sun that we honor
the soil by turning the first sod yourself," said the
wise men, when told about the coming celebration.</p>

<p>"I will," said the prince, who was now called
Manco-Capac, and was the ruler of the kingdom,
"and the Virgins of the Sun shall drop the seeds.
Let every one come in holiday clothes and with
songs and dancing and feasting we will commemorate
the day."</p>

<p>The next morning all the people came together
to watch the sun rise. The Virgins were dressed
in white with wreaths of flowers on their heads
and every one wore ornaments and jewels and was
as blithe and gay as if he were going to a picnic.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig69" id="fig69"></a>
<img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="347" height="451" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"THE PEOPLE SHOUTED HAILLE HAILLE!"<br />
See <a href="#Page_68">opposite page</a></p>
</div>

<p>Just as the sun peeped up over the edge of the
horizon and smiled "good morning" to them, the
Golden Hearted poured a libation on the ground
from a golden goblet, and the people all shouted
"Haille! Haille!" meaning triumph. The prince,
the wise men and everybody faced the risen sun
with bared heads and bowed three times. Then the
prince said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>"Many think that the Sun is the Maker of all
things. But he who makes should abide by what
he has done. Now many things happen when the
sun is absent; therefore he cannot be the universal
creator. And that he is alive at all is doubtful for
his trips do not tire him. Were he a living thing
he would grow weary like ourselves. Were he free
he would visit other parts of the heavens. He is
a tethered beast who makes a daily round under the
eye of the Master. He is like an arrow which must
go whither it is sent; not whither it wishes. I tell
you that he, our father and master, the Sun, must
have a lord more powerful than himself who constrains
him to his daily circuit without pause or
rest."</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted spoke like this because
he did not wish the Children of the Sun to believe
it was really their father or God either.</p>

<p>All the assemblage took off their sandals and
went into the Place of Gold and prayed; then came
out to the court yard and offered up sacrifice of
perfumes, fruits and flowers. When this was done
they hurried to the fields and after the Golden
Hearted turned the first sod every one else began
to work. They had no plows, and those who did not
break the ground with a dull saber, dropped seeds
all day long. As the sun went down they laid aside
their toil, and marched home shouting and singing,
because now they were going to have a feast,
with bonfires and dancing as late into the night as
they wished.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<h2>Bochica and the Zipa</h2>

<div>
<img  class="drop-cap" src="images/i_070.jpg" style="margin-top: -4.5em" width="103" height="263" alt="I" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">
IN the Cinnamon country not far
from Cuzco lived the Muscas, a
rich and powerful nation who
were less civilized than the Children
of the Sun and were so quarrelsome
that they constantly disputed
among themselves. Finally the Zipa,
or king, died and then there was great
danger of war breaking out between
the different factions as to who should
be the new ruler.</p>

<p>At last the oldest son of the dead
Zipa came to Cuzco to ask the Golden
Hearted to decide who should inherit the kingdom.</p>

<p>"This is a matter of grave moment," said he,
"and I must warn you that my time of ruling the
Children of the Sun is near an end. Soon must I
go to build the temple of Guatavita, the Good Life,
and then must I leave this part of the world for
another clime where much work awaits me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>"Come to us and build the temple of Good
Life, and I promise you that both I and my brave
Muscas shall be the guardians of your teachings.
You shall be a demi-god among us."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to be anything more than an
elder brother to you and your people," replied the
Golden Hearted. "I am come from my home to
serve humanity and must go with you if you need
me&mdash;not because you wish to honor me."</p>

<p>The son of the Zipa then offered him many
presents of gold, rich cloth, and precious stones, but
the Golden Hearted refused to accept any of them.
Finally the young man said:</p>

<p>"I am greatly disappointed, good prince, and
have only this piece of bark and a strange kind of
fruit to offer you. The bark is royal in my country
because it cures the hated fever and is worthy your
best confidence. As to the fruit, taste it for yourself."</p>

<p>To his surprise the Golden Hearted and the
wise men were much pleased with the bark which
we know to-day as Peruvian and from which
quinine is made, and the pineapple tastes as
sweet to us as it did to the Golden Hearted.</p>

<p>The son of the Zipa and his nobles conducted
the wise men and the Golden Hearted over one
elevated table-land after another until they came to
one of the highest lakes in the world, where people
can live, and its name is Gautavita.</p>

<p>"These terraced mountain sides show that
your example has been well profited by the Children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
of the Sun," said the son of the Zipa, as they
trudged along the royal roadway leading from
Cuzco to the cinnamon country. "The instruction
of the wise men in building canals and aqueducts
has turned this into a garden spot even though
nature intended it to be barren."</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted thought this would be
a good opportunity to let his new friend know that
he did not approve of war, and that the adherents
of the Good Law, must not fight among themselves,
so he said gently:</p>

<p>"All that you see before you is the working
out of a fixed principle. Universal kindness is the
secret of our success. Treat the earth gently and
with consideration and she blesses you seven fold.
Dig into her bosom and she yields her choicest
treasures, and the beasts and birds respond to your
affectionate touch. The heart of the man is the same,
my friend. The obedience and allegiance of your
subjects must come from the heart. If when I go
among them they tell me they wish you to be their
Zipa then will I go to your opponent and persuade
him to relinquish his claim in your favor."</p>

<p>"And if he does not consent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then must you yield to him peaceably. I
will not allow any blood shed on either side."</p>

<p>The son of the Zipa knew by the firm tone of
the Golden Hearted that he meant what he said
and his face turned a bright red, because he
thought his own selfish purpose was known to his
guest. Down in his heart he was planning to go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
into the capital city with a grand flourish and pretend
that the Children of the Sun had sent their
ruler and wise men to help him capture the throne.
Now he knew very well he would not dare do
anything of the kind.</p>

<p>"But you do not know my people, good
prince," he said. "They will never obey a Zipa
they do not fear."</p>

<p>"I am not familiar with the faces of your
subjects, but I know the heart of all mankind, and
whether he be white or black, young or old, the
child of fortune or the opposite, he is amenable to
the law of love. Win his affection and he will serve
you as faithfully and obediently as a dog."</p>

<p>"I am afraid my turbulent warriors would
not respect such a policy," replied the son of the
Zipa, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Remember in dealing with either man or
animal that fear degrades while love ennobles."</p>

<p>By this time they were coming in sight of the
calm peaceful waters of the lake stretched out like
a sheet of glass before them.</p>

<p>"Water," said the Golden Hearted, "is like
a pure mind&mdash;limpid and clear. It permits us to
look into its depths for hidden treasures, or to see
our own image reflected back from its surface. Let
your heart and mind be such a mirror, and trust
your people to make the right selection."</p>

<p>With this he laid his hand upon the shoulder
of his young companion and as their eyes met, the
son of the Zipa felt certain that he had a loyal and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
disinterested friend who would help him in the
right way.</p>

<p>The next morning the prince and the wise
men called the nobles and warriors together, and
listened patiently to all they had to say for and
against the two candidates. As he came into the
audience chamber the strange one scowled and
frowned at the visitors, but to his surprise the
Golden Hearted took his hand and said:</p>

<p>"We have made a long, wearisome journey, my
brother, in order to serve your own and your
state's best interest. Speak freely that we may be
able to judge fairly between the two."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to tell that my warriors do
not already know," was the curt reply. "I am
able to crush opposition and to command respect
and obedience. I do not need your assistance, sir."</p>

<p>For a moment there was a look of pain on the
face of the Golden Hearted. Then he said gently:</p>

<p>"You, more than any one else need help,
because you are unable to govern yourself much
less a rich and prosperous nation."</p>

<p>When it became known that the representatives
of the Children of the Sun would not compel
the people to accept a Zipa they did not like, they
came out of their houses where they had been hidden
all day for fear of violence, and marched up
and down the streets playing on shell trumpets,
gongs and kettle drums, and shouting the name of
the oldest son of the Zipa who was in due time
crowned as the rightful heir to the throne.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>His first official act was to pierce the upper
part of the ear of his subjects and put in gold
wheels of fine filigree work, as large around as an
orange. As he did so he said to each one:</p>

<p>"Swear by Him who gives and sustains life in
the Universe, that you will faithfully keep the
Good Law brought to us from the sea, by <i>Bochica,
our deliverer</i>."</p>

<p>This was the name the Zipa gave the Golden
Hearted, and as each man passed by him he gave
them a little cake made of corn meal, and
continued:</p>

<p>"To-morrow our good friends leave us for
many days to come, but Bochica will return again,
and to show him that we will do his bidding willingly
let us take balsas or rafts with sails and go
out on the lake where he may see the intent of our
minds reflected in the water. Put wreaths of many
colored flowers on the balsas, and carry with you
gold and emeralds which we will cast into the lake
in token of our pledge to him."</p>

<p>For hundreds of years afterwards, the Mucas
and their descendants kept this holiday as an
anniversary of the departure of the prince and the
wise men. They knew that he was called the
Golden Hearted in the Happy Island, and every
year they selected a young priest from the temple
of Gautavita, to impersonate him. After his bath
the priest smeared himself all over with a fragrant
oil, and then his attendants blew gold dust through
reeds onto his body until he looked like a solid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
statue. They put him in the center of the flower-laden
raft, and with chants and hymns rowed out
on the lake and threw emeralds and gold dust into
it. The young men wore white shirts with a red
cross on the breast, and tied a red sash around
their waists. On their heads were crowns of flowers
and evergreen leaves to show that their virtues
would continue as long as they lived, and that they
were followers of the teachings of the Golden
Hearted. They were always hoping and praying
for his return.</p>

<p>We shall hear more of this ceremony and what
came of it when we read the story of the Gilded
Man.</p>

<h2>Michabo,
the Great White Hare</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_079.jpg" style="margin-top: -7em" width="147" height="294" alt="U" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">UNLESS you know what river
was called the "Father of
Waters" it will be a secret as
to where the Golden Hearted
and the wise men went when
they took leave of the Zipa.
There are many quaint stories told
about this river, and also about the
queer mounds and earthworks built by
a strange race of men who lived ages
ago in that part of our country. Their
descendants are not very civilized and
seem to have forgotten much that their ancestors
knew although they have some very pretty ideas.
For instance, they imagine that they hear voices
in the growing branches and whispering leaves
of the trees, and they see little vanishing men in
the cliffs everywhere. They say that the Great
Spirit makes the Indian summer by puffing smoke
out of his cheeks, from his great peace pipe.</p>

<p>Before the Golden Hearted came they built a
medicine lodge&mdash;a kind of temple facing the sunrise,
in a place called the "Moon of Leaves." When
it was finished, Wunzh, a youth of noble character
and tender heart, summoned the spirits of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
four quarters of the world and the day maker to
come to his fire and disclose the hidden things of
the distance and future.</p>

<p>No one can tell why they named the Golden
Hearted, "Michabo, the Great White Hare,"
unless it was because he came in the time of the year
represented in their calendar by a rabbit. They
kept a record of the seasons by crude pictures
drawn on the inside bark of trees, and with them
the months were called moons.</p>

<p>No one blames them for saying the wise men
were jossakeeds or prophets, because they really
did look peculiar in their long robes, beards and
tall black hats, especially to men who had on buffalo
robes and feather head dresses.</p>

<p>Wunzh and his tribe received the Golden
Hearted with solemn faces and much respect when
they heard that he came from the Four Quarters
of the World, which we know was the land of the
Inca, very far south.</p>

<p>"Welcome, great white chief," they said,
"come and sit by our council fire. Our hearts have
long been weary waiting for you."</p>

<p>When they were all seated Wunzh handed the
Golden Hearted a peace pipe shaped like a tomahawk
filled with tobacco and already lighted. Not
a word was spoken until every one present had
taken three whiffs out of the pipe. Then the
Golden Hearted said:</p>

<p>"I come to speak for my brothers, the fish,
the animals, the creeping things and the feathered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
messengers of the air. I often listen to their complaints
and they charge you with slaying them for
food when the grains and fruits would serve you
better."</p>

<p>"We are not disdainful of the grapes and
berries concealed in our forests," replied Wunzh,
"but we have no grain save rice and this must be
carried on our backs for many days. Our snows and
chill winds kill the plant before its seeds appear."</p>

<p>"Whatever the reason may be you will never
do any real good in the world until you learn how
to fast days at a time and can live without eating
so much flesh. Even your vaunted skill with bow
and arrow is not genuine. I am a better shot."</p>

<p>The wise men were alarmed for a moment
fearing that Wunzh would be angry and that his
followers would be offended also. Besides they had
never heard the Golden Hearted speak boastfully
before, and they were puzzled to know what would
happen next.</p>

<p>"I am willing to try the bow with my friend,"
said Wunzh, with a flash of the eye and a toss of
the head, which showed that he was vain and had
an uncertain temper.</p>

<p>"When will it suit you to make the contest,"
quietly asked the Golden Hearted, as he arose and
turned to leave the council fire.</p>

<p>"To-morrow's sun," answered Wunzh,
haughtily, "and when it is so high," indicating a
space in the sky that would make it quite early in
the morning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>"Let it take place in the large square surrounded
by your lodges," said the Golden Hearted,
carelessly as he walked toward the one assigned for
his use.</p>

<p>To the wise men he said:</p>

<p>"Leave me for a little time, I wish to be
alone."</p>

<p>They wondered what he could mean by such
language and such actions. It was evident that he
did not intend to make any explanation to them,
so they could only wait to see what the outcome
would be.</p>

<p>Once inside the tent the Golden Hearted began
to work on a plaited disc of straw. As soon as it
was finished, he drew rings of red, blue, black and
white all around the big yellow center, and was
propping it up to dry when Wunzh appeared at
the door of the lodge.</p>

<p>"I have come to show you the center pole
where you may hang up the target, and we will
then step off the distance between the different
shooting stations," he said. "The rule requires
each of us to speed two dozen arrows from the
nearest point, twice that many from the middle
ground, and seventy-two from the outside post."</p>

<p>While in the Happy Island, the prince had
learned all about the use of the bow and arrow,
but this was the first time he had an opportunity
to show his skill, and the wise men were anxious
that he should not fail, because they knew that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
the friends of Wunzh would not have much
respect for him if he did. They could not understand
how he could be so smiling and unconcerned.</p>

<p>The fame of Wunzh as a bowman was known
far and wide and the descendants of the Mound
Builders were certain he would win. At daybreak
the next morning there was a solid line of warriors
around the ring where the trial was to be made,
and they were as motionless and stolid looking as
if they had been carved out of wood. No one could
tell by their faces what they were thinking and
they would not have turned their heads for anything.
Some of them made a kind of music on a
tom-tom or Indian drum and Wunzh and the
Golden Hearted marched in step like soldiers, and
smiled and bowed to everybody as they came into
the ring. The Golden Hearted knew all the time
that he was the doubtful one, and just for a
moment he glanced at the anxious faces of the wise
men. Though not sure in their hearts they nodded
encouragingly and before he had touched a bow
every eye in the crowd was upon him.</p>

<p>The keepers of the bows and arrows were very
fair minded, and were careful to see there were
no knots or gnarls or cracks in the waxy brown
hunting bow made of straight grained mulberry
wood. The one to be used was six feet long and
its tips were of polished elk horn, and there was a
buckskin handhold in the center. The hickory
arrows were as smooth as glass with very sharp
saw-teeth edges on the flint heads. Around the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
notch end there were three vanes of eagle feathers.</p>

<p>The descendants of the Mound Builders were
courteous enough to give their guest the first shot.
As the Golden Hearted pulled a buckskin shield
over his right hand he looked up at the wise men,
and his eyes said:</p>

<p>"Trust me! I shall not fail."</p>

<p>Then he stooped quickly and raised the bow
from the ground and placed it against his knee
cap to get a good purchase. With an upward body
movement he drew the long bow as far as he could,
faced the painted disc target and let fly. Like the
arrow that sped so swiftly that it caught fire
as it flew, this one sang through the air and
imbedded itself in the blue ring where it rocked and
shook violently.</p>

<p>"The Great White Hare has won five points!"
shouted the tally keepers in the Judge's corner.</p>

<p>"What skill!" said one pointing to the still
quivering arrow. "What strength!" said another,
while the wise men began to feel very proud indeed.</p>

<p>It was such hard work that the face of Golden
Hearted was flushed but he shut his teeth together
hard, and was determined to make a still better
effort.</p>

<p>His second shot sent the arrow into the red
ring nearly opposite the blue, and this scored him
seven points.</p>

<p>"There is fine aiming!" said the judges to
each other, while the other people leaned over in
their seats and watched intently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>There was just a shadow of a smile on the lips
of the Golden Hearted, as he made ready for the
final shot from the first station.</p>

<p>"Ping!" and the third arrow fairly whistled
as it hit the exact center of the yellow spot.</p>

<p>Instantly the whole crowd were on their feet,
all talking at once and making so much noise that
the tally keepers could not be heard.</p>

<p>"Five&mdash;seven&mdash;nine are the points; twenty-one
for final score," they shouted.</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted flung down his bow and
stepped to one side to make room for Wunzh. He
stood wiping the perspiration off his forehead and
was pleased because he saw that every one felt
kindly toward him.</p>

<p>"Now the jossakeeds will learn how to shoot!"
exclaimed the men who had backed Wunzh.</p>

<p>"He will never equal the first score," said
others who were skillful with a bow and arrow
themselves and knew how hard it was to make
such fine shots.</p>

<p>Wunzh sent his first arrow with a vim and
energy that showed he had been in constant practice,
but all three of his darts sped feebly and
barely indented the black ring.</p>

<p>"The jossakeeds hold the first station,"
announced the judges. "Move on to the next one."</p>

<p>Now came the real test of skill, and every man
was interested because they all made use of the
bow and arrow, in hunting and in war, and had no
other kind of weapon except a knife. Hundreds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
of the spectators left their seats and crowded
around the contestants.</p>

<p>The heavy hunting bow was laid aside now
and one made of elastic but tough yew was substituted.
The arrows had finely-pointed obsidian
heads, matched and smooth but sharp as a needle.</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted was careful to see that
the yew was properly seasoned and when satisfied,
he placed the arrow on the left side of the bow
with its notch set on the string. He drew the
string back to just below the chin, aimed over the
arrow tip and let fly.</p>

<p>The spectators were quick to see that his aim,
draw, finish and loose was perfect even in speeding
the arrows so fast they could scarcely be seen.
When shooting three at a time he drove all of them
into the yellow center within a quarter of an inch
of each other!</p>

<p>The friends of Wunzh shouted and screamed:</p>

<p>"It is not fair! He uses too many arrows. Give
us justice!" until the judges were compelled to
order the warriors to drive the crowd back again
with the points of their spears.</p>

<p>In the noise, confusion and excitement
every one forgot the birds perched on a cross bar at
the top of the pole supporting the target. There
was a blue jay, a raven, a white dove and a green
parrot. Each had a string attached to one leg. Now
of course they remembered and crowded around
to hear what the judges would say.</p>

<p>"Will the prince of the jossakeeds take a shot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
at the birds before being crowned with the Yew
wreath of valor?"</p>

<p>As soon as the Golden Hearted could make
himself heard he said:</p>

<p>"I am willing to comply with your request,
but I hope I shall not hurt any of the birds."</p>

<p>"The parrot shall cry your aim, and must
remain unharmed. You may kill the blue or the
black bird, but you must release the peaceful dove
uninjured. Will you remember these conditions?"</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted came within range and
waited for a favorable opportunity. By a sudden
jerk of the cord coming down the side of the pole
the cross bar was set to whirling rapidly and this
frightened the birds until they tried to fly away.
The parrot was chained fast and to make the aim
more difficult, the other birds were fastened by
strings of different lengths. The marksman must
free each one of them and then hit it before it
could escape. The first liberated was the blue jay.
The Golden Hearted cut the cord neatly and
wounded the bird while it was still rising. The
arrow fell near the base of the pole bringing the
right wing with it.</p>

<p>This won him the wreath, and he now turned to
the wise men for a signal. They could demand the
last three shots. Would they do it? He inclined
his head toward them as one of the number picked
up a black flag and waved it. There was an
answering shout and a cheer, and the Golden
Hearted prepared to shoot again. This time he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
aimed at the raven and cut the string near the pole.
Its weight caused the captive to fly in an oblique
line downward for a moment. Quick as a flash the
second arrow sped and the raven fell to the ground
pierced through the heart! Without looking to see
what had happened the Golden Hearted shot at
the dove and as it flew up in a circle everybody
saw that it was unharmed.</p>

<img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="342" height="269" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"THE HOUSE OF WUNZH"</p>
</div>
<p>Then they fought and struggled with each
other for the privilege of carrying the victor off
the grounds, but the Golden Hearted escaped
through a side door and ran away as fast as he
could. He did not wish to speak to any one nor
have them see how unhappy he felt. He really
was heartbroken because he had killed the raven.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<h2>The Birth of Corn</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_089.jpg" style="margin-top: -.5em" width="150" height="151" alt="W" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">WUNZH was greatly disturbed
and downcast over his defeat
because he thought the Great
Spirit had sent the Golden
Hearted in answer to his
supplications, and he now felt
certain that he was in disfavor. He
lay awake all night thinking what he
could do to win a token of good will
from the Great Spirit. He knew better
than to ask anything for himself, but begged
and implored that it should be something for the
benefit of his tribe.</p>

<p>"Michabo says I eat too much flesh, and that
I must learn to fast before any good will come to
me," he said over and over to himself. "He shall
see that I know how to obey even if my arrows do
go wide of the mark." There was a great lump in
his throat and to tell the truth there were a few
tears trickling down his cheeks, but he brushed
them away quickly as he rose to his feet and shook
out the buffalo robes which had answered for his
bed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>"I will go to a secret place in the forest and
build me a lodge, and there I will stay and fast
until the Great Spirit grants my wish."</p>

<p>He told no one of his intention and was gone
several days before he was missed at the council
fires where the wise men were instructing the medicine
men in the use of a wampum belt made of
different colored beads. The colors were the same
as the Quippos and the counting with them was
done in the same manner. While the women were
weaving a very handsome wampum belt to be used
as a council brand of authority, the wise men
helped build a Long House in the center of the
confederation of tribes to put it in. Then they
ordered four other Long Houses built on the north,
east, south and west corners of the country, so that
the runners would have some place to stay when
they started with the wampum belt to let the outside
tribes know the will of the council.</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted did not seem to take any
interest in this work at all, but went among the
people playing all kinds of pranks. Sometimes he
frightened them nearly to death, and then again he
would set them into roars of laughter by the funny
things he did. He invented so many tricks and was
so full of mischief that every one was on the lookout
and attributed all the happenings they could
not account for in any other way to him whether
he did them or not.</p>

<p>"What has become of Wunzh? Has anybody
seen him?" began to be constant queries, and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
family looked very sad indeed. The Golden
Hearted knew where he was and that he was fasting,
so he waited until nightfall and then dressed
himself in rich garments of green and yellow shading
into light and dark tints. Putting on his crown
with the long green Quetzal plumes he slipped off
into the woods to find Wunzh. Approaching the
lodge he said:</p>

<p>"I am sent to you, my friend, by that Great
Spirit who made all things in the sky and on the
earth. He has seen and known your motives in the
fasting. He sees that it is from a kind and benevolent
wish to do good to your people and to procure
a benefit for them and not for strength in war or
the praise of warriors. I come to show you how to
do your kindred good, but you must rise and
wrestle with me."</p>

<p>Wunzh knew that he was weak from fasting,
but felt his courage rising in his heart, and he got
up immediately determined to die rather than fail.</p>

<p>He instantly clinched with the Golden Hearted
and wrestled with him until nearly exhausted.</p>

<p>"My friend, this is enough for to-day. I will
come again to try you to-morrow at the same
hour."</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted came dressed in the same
fashion and wrestled with Wunzh for three successive
evenings. Each day the faster's strength
grew less and less, but he was more determined
than ever.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig93" id="fig93"></a>
<img src="images/i_092.jpg" width="348" height="423" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE WRESTLING MATCH</p>
</div>

<p>"To-morrow will be your last trial. Be strong,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
my friend, for this is the only way you can overcome
me and obtain the boon you seek."</p>

<p>The next day the poor youth exerted his
utmost power and after awhile the Golden
Hearted ceased wrestling.</p>

<p>"I am conquered," he said, and went into the
lodge and began to teach Wunzh. "You have
wrestled manfully and have fasted seven days.
Now you must strip off my clothing and throw me
down. Clean the earth of roots and reeds; make
it soft and bury these garments here. When you
have done this be careful never to let the grass grow
over the spot. Once a month cover it with fresh
earth. If you follow these instructions you will do
great good to your fellow creatures."</p>

<p>In the morning the father of Wunzh came
with some slight refreshments, saying:</p>

<p>"My son, you have fasted long enough. If the
Great Spirit intends to favor you he will do it now.
It is seven days since you tasted food and you
must not sacrifice your health. That the Master of
Life does not require of you."</p>

<p>"Wait, father, until the sun goes down. I have
a particular reason for extending my fast until
that hour."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the father, kindly. "I will
wait until you feel inclined to eat."</p>

<p>Even though he was hungry the young man
felt strangely renewed and strengthened and when
it was night he was ready to wrestle with the
Golden Hearted again. When he thought he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
killed the prince he took off his garments and
plumes and buried them as he had been told to do.
Afterwards he returned to his father's lodge and
partook sparingly of food, but he never for a
moment forgot the new-made grave.</p>

<p>Because he was so full of pranks and tricks,
the descendants of the Mound Builders saw something
mysterious and strange in everything the
Golden Hearted did, and when he built a boat to
go down the great river in, they said it was a magic
canoe and expected almost anything to happen.
However before he and the wise men went away,
they made him the father and guardian of their
nation, and they have considered him as such ever
since.</p>

<p>Weeks went by and the summer was drawing
to a close when Wunzh returned after a long
absence in hunting. Going to his father he invited
him to come to the quiet lonesome spot where he
had fasted so long. There in a circle freed from
weeds stood a tall graceful plant with bright colored
silken hair surmounted by nodding plumes,
luxuriant green leaves and clusters of golden grain
on each side.</p>

<p>"It is my friend, and the friend of all mankind.
It is Mondamin, the spirit of corn. We need
no longer rely on hunting alone for so long as
this gift is cherished and taken care of the ground
itself will give us a living. See, my father," said
Wunzh, pulling off an ear, "this is what I fasted
for. This is why Michabo put me through so many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
trials. But the Great Spirit has listened to my voice
and sent us something new. Our people need no
longer depend upon the chase and the water for
food."</p>

<p>Then he told his father how he had wrestled
with the Golden Hearted, and how he had torn off
his garments.</p>

<p>"He said I was to treat the ear in the same
manner, and when it was stripped I must hold it
to the fire until the outer skin becomes brown while
all the milk is retained in the grain."</p>

<p>The whole family of Wunzh joined in a feast
on the roasted ears, and were very grateful for such
a rich blessing. And this is the way the Indians
say corn came into the world.</p>

<p>We learned its use from them, and also to hold
the old-fashioned husking bees where all the young
people got together and pulled off the husks after
the ripe ears of corn had been gathered into the
barn. It was always great fun, especially when
they found red ears, but let us see what the Indians
used to say about it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Then Nokomis, the old woman,</p>
<p>Spake and said to Minnehaha:</p>
<p>"'Tis the moon when leaves are falling</p>
<p>All the wild rice has been gathered</p>
<p>And the maize is ripe and ready;</p>
<p>Let us gather in the harvest,</p>
<p>Let us wrestle with Mondamin,</p>
<p>Strip him of his plumes and tassels,</p>
<p>Of his garments green and yellow."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>
<p class="i1">And the merry Laughing Water</p>
<p>Went rejoicing from the wigwam,</p>
<p>With Nokomis old and wrinkled,</p>
<p>And they called the women round them,</p>
<p>Called the young men and the maidens,</p>
<p>To the harvest of the cornfields,</p>
<p>To the husking of the maize ear.</p>
<p class="i1">On the border of the forest,</p>
<p>Underneath the fragrant pine-trees,</p>
<p>Sat the old man and the warriors</p>
<p>Smoking in the pleasant shadow</p>
<p>In uninterrupted silence</p>
<p>Looked they at the gamesome labor</p>
<p>Of the young men and the women;</p>
<p>Listened to their noisy talking,</p>
<p>To their laughter and their singing</p>
<p class="i1">Heard them chattering like the magpies,</p>
<p>Heard them laughing like the blue-jays,</p>
<p>Heard them singing like the robins.</p>
<p class="i1">And whene'er some lucky maiden</p>
<p>Found a red ear in the husking</p>
<p>Found a maize-ear red as blood is,</p>
<p>"Nuska!" cried they all together,</p>
<p>"Nuska! you shall have a sweetheart,</p>
<p>You shall have a handsome husband!"</p>
<p>"Ugh!" the old men all responded</p>
<p>From their seats behind the pine-trees.</p>
<p class="i1">And whene'er a youth or maiden</p>
<p>Found a crooked ear in husking,</p>
<p>Found a maize-ear in the husking</p>
<p>Blighted, mildewed or misshapen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>
<p>Then they laughed and sang together,</p>
<p>Crept and limped about the cornfields,</p>
<p>Mimicked in their gait and gestures</p>
<p>Some old man bent almost double,</p>
<p>Singing singly or together</p>
<p>Till the cornfields rang with laughter,</p>
<p>"Ugh!" the old men all responded,</p>

<p>The Indians have many pretty stories about
the birth of corn. When the two little slender green
leaves come up through the ground they say that
it is the long green plumes of the crown buried by
Wunzh and when it is ready for harvest they think
the green and gold of the leaves and grain are
the rest of the garments turned into a plant. They
say that if you stand near a cornfield in the moonlight
you can hear Mondamin, the corn spirit, murmuring
and complaining of the way we treat him
to the wind, the stars, and the little insects hidden
in the glossy leaves and silken tassels.</p>

<h2>The Wrathy Chieftain</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_098.jpg" style="margin-top: -7em" width="150" height="195" alt="A" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">AFTER sailing down the great river
for many days the Golden
Hearted and the wise men came
into a trackless waste with no
means of finding their way out
except by watching where the
sun rose and shooting an arrow ahead of them.
This was very slow work and they all grew quite
discouraged over it.</p>

<p>"It is altogether too bad that for fear of getting
lost we must halt each time and speed another
arrow before we overtake the last one," said the
Golden Hearted one day when they were nearly
worn out with the heat and dust of a country not
much better than a desert. "I have a feeling," he
continued, "that we will not be well treated by the
people we find here. I do so wish we might come to
the cactus and the rock with a serpent at its base
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
where my father commanded me to found a city in
honor of the sun."</p>

<p>"We are going in the right direction,"
answered the wise men, "but the end of our search
is not yet."</p>

<p>"And much as my heart yearns for the Happy
Island I will not return to my father until all his
wishes have been fulfilled."</p>

<p>Through the murky gray clouds the stars did
not make much light, and there was only a thin
crescent moon, which gave a sense of utter loneliness
to the Golden Hearted when he went to bed
that night. The coyotes all around him howled
and that made it worse, but he finally fell asleep.
By and by he was awakened by a cold, wet nose
touching his hand, and when he raised up on his
elbow to see what it was, there stood a coyote. They
are not very dangerous animals but they are
sneaking and treacherous. Now we know that
the Golden Hearted was gentle and kind to all
creatures, and the coyote must have known it too,
for it rubbed its head on his hand and did not seem
in the least afraid.</p>

<p>"Come, my good fellow, let us be friends,"
said the Golden Hearted. "I will not hurt you, and
you can guide me to my brethren. I have never
seen their faces, but wish very much to find them."</p>

<p>The coyote wrinkled up his nose and made a
funny little sneezing sound as if he were talking,
and he wagged his tail as friendly as a dog.
Maybe he did not understand what was said to him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
but anyhow he felt safe enough to lie down close to
his new friend and go sound asleep. When the
wise men saw him the next morning, they said:</p>

<p>"It is a good omen and means that we shall
soon come to a stopping place where strange events
will happen."</p>

<p>This put the Golden Hearted into a better
humor because he felt less doubtful and discouraged
and he was much interested in the antics of the
sagacious little companion that trudged by his side
all day long. The coyote was enterprising enough
to kill as many birds as it needed for food, without
going far out of the way and was not a whit of
trouble to anybody. There was not a tree nor a
shrub to hide the nakedness of the dusty plains,
nor was it possible to rest with any comfort until
after the sun went down.</p>

<p>All of a sudden the coyote stopped short,
pricked up its ears and listened intently.</p>

<p>"Yelp! yelp! yelp!" was what the Golden
Hearted heard, and it sounded as if there were hundreds
of young puppies everywhere. Looking
closely he discovered little heaps of earth with a
smooth-headed animal sitting on all fours beside
it and yelping a protest to being disturbed. They
were right in the midst of a village of prairie dogs,
which are about the size of a jack-rabbit, but not
nearly so destructive.</p>

<p>"Come and see what I have found," called out
the Golden Hearted to the wise men who were coming
up behind him. At the sound of his voice the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
prairie dogs gave a quick, short yelp, their heels
twinkled in the air for a second, and they fairly
turned a somersault diving into their holes. By
the time the wise men were ready to look there was
not a whisker of an inhabitant to be seen.</p>

<p>"What is it?" they said, "Where! we do not
see anything."</p>

<p>"Watch these fresh piles of dirt, and you will
see something come out of them," said the Golden
Hearted.</p>

<p>"Yes;" said one, "there are some rattlesnakes."</p>

<p>"And here are some owls," said another. "Is
it possible that you have never seen these creatures
before?" and the wise men laughed at the Golden
Hearted and thought they had a good joke on him.</p>

<p>"Let us keep quiet for a while. I tell you there
is something else in those burrows besides snakes
and owls," he insisted seriously.</p>

<p>Not hearing any more noise, one after another
of the little prairie dogs put its head up out of the
hole, and then stole forth cautiously to talk the
matter over with its next door neighbor. There
were regular beaten pathways or lanes from one
burrow to another and they were evidently on very
friendly footing with each other.</p>

<p>"These are indeed curious little animals,"
said the wise men, now much interested. "They not
only live in communities, but keep the peace with
their brothers, the snake and the owl. There is
certainly no greater source of knowledge than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
book of nature. Here God puts before us the thing
He wishes us to learn."</p>

<p>At the very first words of the wise men the
prairie dogs scampered back into their holes; and
before they showed themselves again a party of
husbandmen came along on their way to a harvest
field which they said was a day's journey ahead.</p>

<p>"Why do you linger in this desert?" they
asked of the Golden Hearted. "There are habitations
farther on where the earth is watered."</p>

<p>"We are seeking those who need our assistance
and must only tarry where we are welcome,"
he answered.</p>

<p>"Then come to our commune. We have no one
to show us how to heal the sick nor to coax fertility
out of this barren soil," they said. "If you
will go, we will remain for the night and lead the
way."</p>

<p>So it was arranged and to everybody's comfort
and joy it began to rain shortly after and then the
air was much more cool and pleasant.</p>

<p>The little prairie dogs were not so well pleased
with this arrangement. They stuck their noses up
into the moist air and whined and yelped half of
the night. There can be no doubt that they were
holding an indignation meeting, and were having
a noisy and windy debate. May be they were comparing
notes about the tall hats and veils of the
wise men, or they may not have thought their long
beards becoming. Or who shall say that they were
not in their own peculiar fashion devising plans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
for safety, and to vindicate their offended dignity?
They may have objected seriously to having
strange men intruding upon their privacy, and it
must not be considered a reflection on their courage
because they scampered out of sight at the sound of
a human voice. It was quite enough to frighten
inoffensive little animals like these.</p>

<p class="caption">"THE WRATHY CHIEFTAIN"</p>
</div>

<p>It is said that Katzimo, the enchanted Mesa,
was the first stopping-place of the Golden Hearted,
and it is certain that the wise men taught the husbandmen
in that part of the world how to make
irrigating ditches and canals all through their
inhospitable country, because there are many
remains of these waterways still to be seen. Some
say, too, that these people got the idea of living in
pueblos or villages from studying the habits of the
prairie dogs and to this day the coyote is thought
to be a good friend by the descendants of these
ancient husbandmen.</p>

<p>"The hunters are angry with you for teaching
the tillers of the soil how to make the land fertile
without making it easier for the men of the chase
to get food for themselves and families," said an
old woman to the Golden Hearted, one day as he
stood watching her make a water jar of clay. She
would not have spoken had he not shown her how
to make a pretty design and also how to ornament
it differently from anything she had seen
before.</p>

<p>"I am willing to teach them to weave blankets
and baskets," he replied. "The Good Law spares
the life of every creature and forbids our eating its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
flesh for food. The hunters should give up the
chase and fighting."</p>

<p>"They say that only women should do these
things," said the old pottery maker, "and they
disdain to carry the rocks and mud to make our
dwellings."</p>

<p>"In this they are wrong," said the Golden
Hearted, kindly, as he turned to greet some of the
wise men. "We must hasten our task for already
is discontent showing itself among the tribes," he
said to them.</p>

<p>"We must kindle the sacred fires and build the
temple at once," they said. "We have heard murmurings
and complaints of late and know your
words are true."</p>

<p>As soon as possible they began the work of
construction of what is now known as the Casa
Grande long since in ruins, of which we shall hear
more in the story of the Kingdom of Quivera. The
wise men kindled and guarded the sacred fires, and
when leaving appointed warriors to take turns in
watching them.</p>

<p>"You must serve for two successive days and
live during that time without food, drink or sleep,"
they said, and that mandate has been kept to this
day. In the meantime the Golden Hearted busied
himself with teaching them the use of herbs and
plants for medicine and had them go into estufas
or sweat houses when they were ill or wished to
purify themselves of a sin or fault.</p>

<p>Tradition says that the hunters lured the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Golden Hearted away from his comrades and tried
to kill him, and that they threw the wise men over
the edge of the cliff, but it has been so long ago
that no one can remember what it was they did that
wounded and hurt him. One day he planted a tree
upside down and calling all the people about him
said:</p>

<p>"Many, many years from now a strange
nation will oppress you, and there will be no more
rain. I charge you to guard the sacred fires well
until the tree I have planted falls. Then I will come
back and bring a white race that will overcome
your enemies. After that the rain will fall, and
the earth will be fertile again."</p>

<p>The simple, frugal husbandmen and weavers
are still looking for his return and they believe he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
will descend from the sky by the columns of smoke
they guard. It has been so long ago that they think
he lives in the sun now, and build their houses
with an opening to the east which is never closed.</p>

<p>"We do this that he may find a welcome when
he comes," they say.</p>

<p>Once every fifty years they put out all the
sacred fires and go up on the high mountain tops
just before dawn, and wail and mourn and break
pottery, imploring the shining orb to bring back
him</p>

<h2>The Plumed Serpent, Quetzalcoatl</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_108.jpg" width="142" height="148" alt="F" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">FAR as the eye could reach
stretched the beautiful valley of
Anahuac, where the air was sweet
with the breath of flowers, and the
earth seemed to melt perfectly into
the sky.</p>

<p>"Oh! that mine eyes should see
the splendor of this vision," said
Mexi, the oldest of the wise men
and the most learned, clasping his
hands in rapture. "Oh! that I have
been spared to see the fruition of thy will, great
king and brother. Now may I go hence in peace."</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking he tottered and would
have fallen had not one of the tamanes or porters,
seated on mats under the shade of a giant oak,
hastily risen, and caught him as his head fell forward
on his bosom.</p>

<p>"The elements have undone thee," cried the
Golden Hearted, kneeling hurriedly by his side
and supporting the drooping head on his knee.
"Thou art sadly in need of rest," he continued,
alarmed at the pallor overspreading Mexi's finely
wrinkled face.</p>

<p>The old man pushed the thin white locks of
hair off his forehead, let the mantle slip back from
his throat, and seemed to breathe easier.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>"I am come to my final rest," he replied with
a feeble smile. "It is not given me to enter the
promised land."</p>

<p>The tawny, broad-shouldered, half-clad
tamanes, laid down the thin cakes of ground corn
they were eating and came near to the stricken old
man, while the other wise men took off their hats
and listened with bowed heads to what their comrade
and leader said. They had stopped to rest
and refresh themselves with food under the cool
inviting shade of the trees where they could listen
to the murmur of waterfalls, and feast, the eyes
on the landscape surrounding them.</p>

<p>"There!" said Mexi, attracted by the buzzing
of tiny wings, "is the green-throated humming-bird
thou wert to follow as thy guide to the spot
where a city is to be built in honor of the sun."</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted held up his hand with the
forefinger extended and in a moment the little
humming-bird lighted on it and looked at him
curiously, as though obeying the will of some one.
He did not touch it nor attempt to move for a few
moments. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Little brother, spend the remainder of thy
days with me. I need thee sorely, and have long
waited for thy guidance."</p>

<p>In the meantime the wise men had given Mexi
a cup of chocolate, not in a thin liquid like we
know it, but thick like a cold custard, and with
whipped goat's cream on top.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig111" id="fig111"></a>
<img src="images/i_110.jpg" width="345" height="486" alt="ALT" />
<p class="caption">"THE HUMMING-BIRD ALIGHTED ON HIS FINGER"<br />
See <a href="#Page_110">opposite page</a></p>
</div>

<p>"Thou art kind," he said growing weaker and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
more faint all the time, "to try to prolong a life
already spent." Turning his eyes toward the
Golden Hearted he continued: "Lying next my
heart thou wilt find a bundle of mystery. Carry it
without opening until the time of thy departure
from this strange land is at hand. Open then and
thou wilt find directions for thy special work."</p>

<p>He did not speak again and when they tried to
rouse him there was a smile of infinite peace on his
face, but nothing save the lifeless body was before
them. The gentle, sweet spirit of the old man had
gone back to God.</p>

<p>"We will neither weep nor mourn for him,"
said the wise men to the Golden Hearted. "It
would not be his wish, and we will show our love by
obeying him."</p>

<p>And so they left him sleeping in a dell of ferns
and mosses, in sight of Anahuac, the land by the
side of water, as its name indicates, and continued
their journey southward.</p>

<p>On the way the wise men found a little
creature, looking like a black currant with neither
head, legs nor tail, so far as they could see. It is fat
and dark and round, but if you squeeze him his
blood is a brighter color than currant juice, and
much more valuable because we get cochineal red
of one, and currant jelly from the other. It was in
the valley of Anahuac that the cochineal bug was
first found, and it lives on the leaves of the prickly
pear, or tuna cactus&mdash;the common kind with leaves
shaped like a ham, and covered with long sharp
needles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>The young cochineal bugs are so stupid that
they must be tied on the leaves of the prickly pear
to keep them from falling off and starving. In this
way, too, they keep dry and warm in winter, but
as soon as they are grown they are ruthlessly
shaken to death and dried in the sun. Then the
queer, shriveled dead bugs are put up in bags and
sold.</p>

<p>"In the hot lands far to the south, the woods
are full of rare orchids and other gems of the
flower kingdom," said the Golden Hearted one day
after a search for plants by the wayside, "but the
vanilla bean is the only one fit for food. It will be
well worth our while to study this strange branch
of husbandry as soon as possible."</p>

<p>It was a long time before they came to a place
near the seashore where a number of women were
picking the ripe pods from vanilla vines which
overran the trees and shrubs completely. The
younger women had on bright-colored petticoats
and gay scarfs over their long black hair, and they
were storing the bean pods in wide-mouthed
baskets strapped across their foreheads.</p>

<p>"What next do you do with these pods?" he
asked of a young girl passing him with a full
basket.</p>

<p>"We carefully assort them and then plunge
the packages into hot water, before laying them
out on mats to drain. For a week the beans are
exposed to the heat of the sun, laid between woolen
blankets. After this we pack them in ollas and keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
them warm so as to promote fermentation while
drying. This makes them soft, pliable, free from
moisture, and of a dark chocolate color thickly
frosted with needle-like crystals of acid."</p>

<p>And to this day if you buy vanilla beans they
come in packages wrapped in silver foil, and have
a delicious odor.</p>

<p>The bean is from six to nine inches long, and
must be ground fine before it can be used in making
the chocolate we are all so fond of, but it is
dried and packed in the same manner as that
described to the Golden Hearted.</p>

<p>It was not many days after leaving the wooded
plains, that the travelers came in sight of four
beautiful lakes with the frowning cliffs of Chapultepec
outlined against the sky. Always on the
alert for a sign the wise men said to each other
in awe-stricken whispers:</p>

<p>"We must be near the place."</p>

<p>"Do you not see the rock with the flowering
cactus!"</p>

<p>"And an eagle circling in the air with a serpent
in its claws!"</p>

<p>"Oh! thou seen and unseen powers! search our
hearts that thou mayst know all our gratitude,"
cried the Golden Hearted, falling on his knees and
then prostrating himself on the ground, as did all
the wise men.</p>

<p>"I am Guatamo," said a voice, and when the
Golden Hearted looked up, a man old as Mexi stood
blessing him. "Rise and receive word from thy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
father, the king from whom I am come. Fear me
not; these hands have guided thy baby footsteps.
Now must thou lend ear to my counsel."</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted was overjoyed to see some
one from his father's court, and also glad to know
that his wanderings in search of the place to honor
the sun was over.</p>

<p>"This is not a promising outlook," said Guatamo,
"but in the parchment scroll thou wilt find
ample instructions to drain and render this a garden
spot of exceeding loveliness. Hasten thy task
since thy father is no longer living, and thy native
land longs to see thee again."</p>

<p>Acting upon this advice the Golden Hearted
and the wise men set to work at once to build the
city, and to teach the willing natives to cultivate
the land, and to make handsome mosaics out of the
bright-colored feathers of the birds found in the
forests in such numbers. Of course the birds were
not killed to get their feathers, but in the royal
gardens there were thousands of them kept during
the moulting season, and then the feathers were
picked up and assorted for use. Not only could they
make perfect representations of birds and animals
with them, but whole landscape scenes, including
mountains, sea and sky. When finished it was necessary
to touch them to know that feathers instead
of paint had been used.</p>

<p>"The Nahuas have come from Aztlan, the
white country, and must be obeyed," was the word
carried from one tribe to the other by the runners,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
and the wise men could only smile when they heard
themselves called Nahuas, or wizards. The simple
natives thought them capable of performing miracles
because they were wise in the arts and knew
how to heal the sick. The name of the Golden
Hearted became Quetzalcoatl, the plumed serpent
in their language, but we must remember that he
wore the Quetzal plumes in his head-dress, the same
as a king wears a gold and jeweled crown, and that
a serpent in many of the languages of the ancient
people meant a very wise man. In English we
would say that the Golden Hearted was the wise
king, which was not only true but a very simple
name for him. The wonderful city he built was
called Tenochtitlan, which signified "in honor of
the sun," as his father had commanded him to do,
and on the spot where it stood is the City of Mexico
to-day. We shall hear very interesting things
about the teocalli, or temple he built in Tenochtitlan,
when we come to the story of "Montezuma and
the Paba," for this is one of the most famous places
in the new world, and no one can afford to be
ignorant of its traditions and history.</p>

<h2>Cholula, the Sacred City</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_116.jpg" width="116" height="118" alt="I" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT was in the Tonituah, or great
sun age, that the wise men and
the Golden Hearted built the
Memento for Generations, on
the plains of Puebla. It is not
so high, but is twice as long
as any other pyramid in the
world, and is truncated, that
is to say, it has four terraces which are reached
by long circular staircases. On top there is an acre
of ground on which once stood a wonderful teocalli
or temple, built by the wise men, and dedicated to
the Golden Hearted. Each generation added something
to the beauties of the Sacred City, Cholula,
which sprang up near the pyramid, and for all time
it will be one of the most wonderful things ever
done by primitive men, who did not have our kind
of implements to work with.</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted lived in Cholula twenty
years, and during that time he taught so many men
how to make fine filigree work in gold and silver
that there were whole streets filled with them, and
the ornaments they made were famous for delicacy
of design and finish.</p>

<p>There was also a mountain of outcry, where
the laws enacted by him were proclaimed by runners,
but it is difficult to say whether this was
Orizaba, with her conical snow-capped head far to
the east, or whether it was huge Popocatepetl, or his
twin sister who stood like colossal sentinels to
guard the enchanted regions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>"It is necessary to construct a calendar stone,
so that the people will know when to hold festivals,
and what ceremonies to perform," said the son of
Guatamo to the Golden Hearted, one day while the
long line of men were passing bricks by hand from
the lower to the upper terrace of the pyramid which
they were trying to finish.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking about it," he replied,
"and have decided to ask a certain old woman, and
her husband, to help select the signs."</p>

<p>"Be sure to make them plain to the people and
appropriate to the subject," said the son of
Guatamo, who had now become the chief adviser of
the Golden Hearted. All of the wise men were still
called Nahuas, or wizards, and the Golden Hearted
was their plumed serpent, or wise king.</p>

<p>In the evening of that day, the Golden Hearted
approached the hut of a famous soothsayer and
story-teller&mdash;the old woman he wished to consult
about the calendar. Standing in front of the door
of the hut he said:</p>

<p>"A humble applicant claims thy assistance in
a matter of great import to thy fellows now and for
all time. Wilt thou kindly hear me?"</p>

<p>"Since it is always for thy brothers and never
for thyself thou art constrained to invoke aid, I am
honored by thy confidence," she said. "I have
long been expecting thee."</p>

<p>"Then thou knowest that I wish to invent a
calendar which can be cut in enduring stone?" he
asked, considerably surprised that she should
already know his thoughts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "and so well do I understand
thy wishes and needs that I have the first
sign ready for thee." Motioning him to follow her
into an inner room, she showed him a water-snake
she had painted on a piece of parchment, and
continued:</p>

<p>"Make it the sign of the serpent, the symbol
of wisdom, since thou art come to teach brotherhood
to all our tribes."</p>

<p>A queer hunchbacked old man sat huddled up
in a corner looking over a set of parchment leaves
lying on a table before him, and muttering to himself
in a low tone.</p>

<p>"My husband must make the next selection,"
said the old crone, going up to him and taking a
paper out of his hands. "He makes it two cones,"
she continued, examining the design closely.</p>

<p>"Now it is my turn to choose," said the Golden
Hearted, "and I will select the three houses from
this pile, and make that the third sign."</p>

<p>They took turns about until twelve signs were
chosen, then the Golden Hearted said:</p>

<p>"I will make the last design myself, but not
until my time of departure is at hand."</p>

<p>"Before going, do not forget to inscribe the
face of the pyramid, and also to explain its import
fully," said the story-teller as the Golden Hearted
was leaving her hut.</p>

<p>"Thou art better able than I am to tell the
hidden significance of that wonderful pile," he
answered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>"But it is thy duty; shirk it not," she said
with decision.</p>

<p>Not long afterward he called all the workmen
and their families together and said:</p>

<p>"There has now come a time in my life when
I must live in seclusion away from the thoughts
and occupations of my associates. But before
going up on top of the pyramid to live alone until
the altars in its temples are ready to receive the
sacred fire, I will tell you why we have tarried so
long and made such a wonderful structure. It is
really a pillar of the Cosmos, or world, and is a
center of fire which is the essence of all life."</p>

<p>The name pyramid means a place of fire or a
volcano, and the Goddess Pele, of the native
Hawaiians, is the spirit of the volcano.</p>

<p>"A pyramid," continued the Golden Hearted,
"is the ideal form of the principle of stability
because it cannot be destroyed. An earthquake will
not shake it down, nor can it be set on fire. Being so
big at the bottom and so heavy it is secure from
floods of water, nor can the wind possibly blow it
over. Neither time nor the elements will have any
influence on this cunningly constructed pile, and
for this reason it is like a noble character, which
no adverse circumstance ever changes."</p>

<p>Approaching the front of the pyramid, he
pulled down a cloth hanging over the inscription
cut in symbols on the face of a huge piece of
granite.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>BEFORE THE LIGHT WAS OBSCURED
THIS MEMENTO FOR GENERATIONS WAS
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
BUILT BY SERPENT KINGS. THEY WERE
SCATTERED OVER THE EARTH TO CARRY
TRUTH AND WISDOM. THEY WILL
COME AGAIN TO RECEIVE THE TREASURES
HIDDEN IN MY BOWELS. THEN ALL
MEN WILL SPEAK AND HEAR THE GREAT
IMPERISHABLE TRUTH.</p>
</div>

<p>The next morning the Golden Hearted called
his little band of wise men around him and said:</p>

<p>"In the Bundle of Wonderful Things given me
by Guatamo, I find my father's final command. It
imposes seclusion upon me in this spot. The temple
requires a central spire and I shall build and cover
it with pure gold. Go thou to the valley and make
thy life apart from me. I love thee well, and shall
miss thee sadly, but I have need to be alone."</p>

<p>"What wilt thou have us do?" asked the son
of Guatamo.</p>

<p>"Go thou amongst thy fellows and teach them
the arts of peace. Show them how to coax fertility
anew out of the soil, and strengthen civil power
until I call thee."</p>

<p>It was several months before the spire was
finished, and then it required several days to make
a llama of beaten silver as an emblem of suffering
innocence to put on the altar. The llama seated
upon the back of an eagle was rescuing a rabbit
from the fangs of a rattlesnake.</p>

<p>"This quaint symbol shall represent the unequal
conflict between the good and bad things
in life, but the llama compelling the serpent to give
up its prey means that good shall finally triumph,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
said the Golden Hearted, to himself, as he put the
offering in place on the altar.</p>

<p>"I have only a few days more in this beautiful
spot, then must I return to good King Cocomos,
my life-long friend and follower. Well indeed has
he kept his promise to me, and not only are his
subjects blessed with all the arts of civilization, but
they are a shining example to other less favored
races. I must offer a fitting sacrifice," he continued,
"on this newly erected altar before I go."</p>

<p>There were eight altars in the temple on top
of the pyramid, and at sunset on the last day of his
stay, the Golden Hearted placed the llama on the
one facing the east. At the same time the son of
Guatamo headed a procession of wise men at the
base of the pyramid, who slowly climbed to the top.
They performed sacrifice on each terrace as they
ascended, and did not reach the temple until
midnight.</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted was alone in the great
dark structure intently watching the constellation
of the Pleiades directly overhead. As Alcyone, the
dim star in the center of the group, approached the
zenith, he sprang forward with a glad cry and vigorously
swinging a copper hammer made the
sparks fly from a piece of flint. The son of venerable
Guatamo held the bit of cotton over it and
carefully nursed the fire into a blaze. As the light
streamed up toward the heavens shouts of joy and
triumph burst forth:</p>

<p>"Once more the children of men receive a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
direct ray from the spiritual sun! Awake! awake!
and hear the glad tidings!"</p>

<p>Runners with torches lighted at the blazing
beacon sped in every direction carrying the cheering
element to all parts of the country. Long before
sunrise it was brightening the altars and hearthstones
in every house. The Golden Hearted prayed
before the eastern altar, and then took an affectionate
farewell of the young priest of the Order
of Quetzalcoatl left in charge, but before descending,
he gazed long at the matchless scenery below.
Soft spring verdure lay on all sides, and he drew
courage and inspiration from that fact. At the
foot of the pyramid he said:</p>

<p>"Be of good cheer. A long era of peace and
prosperity is for thee and thine. Let this knowledge
be thy secret refuge lest thou be tempted to
depart from the way. Grieve not for me, in the fullness
of time I will come again."</p>

<p>Then he set out for the Kingdom of Tlapalla,
accompanied by four youths of noble birth. At the
water's edge he took leave of them saying:</p>

<p>"Guard well the temple and the sacred fires,
for when I come again, I will bring disciples with
me who shall possess and rule the land."</p>

<p>When the four youths returned to Cholula and
told all their master had said to them, the people
divided their province into four principalities and
gave the government to the four young nobles. Ever
after, four of the descendants of these youths continued
to rule as priests of the Order of Quetzalcoatl
in the sacred city until the Spaniards came,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
which we will know all about when we read the
story of "El Dorado, the Golden."</p>

<p>One of the first things done by the noble youths
when they became rulers was to make a statue of
the Golden Hearted in a reclining position, because
they said that he had gone to sleep in the bosom
of the sun. When the wind blew they said he was
sweeping the roads, and that he was the god of fertility.
Not any place else in the new world was
there so much reverence and respect paid to a statue
as to this one of the Golden Hearted which was for
ages kept in the temple he built on the top of the
pyramid. For hundreds of miles around people
came to do reverence to it, and even if it did have
a black face, the ancient Aztecs always called him
their "Fair God." And to this day the calendar
stone and many other wonderful things in Mexico
are said to have been made by him.</p>

<h2>Tulla, the Hiding Nook of the Snake</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_124.jpg" width="79" height="96" alt="N" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">NO doubt you remember that the
wise men built a Dark House in
Nachan to hold the National Book,
and such other treasures as the Golden
Hearted did not wish to carry with
him. And you also remember that
he left a number of wise men in
charge, and that he promised to return. The
great pyramid at Cholula was not all finished,
but it was far enough along so he could leave
the son of Guatamo to go on with the work
while he paid a visit to his old friends in Nachan.</p>

<p>When he arrived there, he found a splendid
city having whole houses of silver, others of turquoise,
some of white and red shells and some of
rich feathers. Cotton grew there in all colors, so
it was not necessary to dye it, and the people were
rich and prosperous. A great and mighty king
ruled them, but he finally grew jealous because the
people seemed to think that all their good fortune
came from obeying the commands given them by
the Golden Hearted when he visited them as a
mere youth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>They did everything in their power to honor
the good prince. When he promulgated a new
law, they ran to the mountain tops and proclaimed
it in a loud voice, and then the swift-footed couriers
dashed through the country with lighted
torches and repeated it to every one they met. One
day a young man came to him and said:</p>

<p>"Good prince, be on your guard. The king
no longer loves you."</p>

<p>"Why do you say this to me?" asked the
Golden Hearted.</p>

<p>"Because I know he plots to injure you. He
is angry because you are helping the wise men
build Tulla. He calls it the Hiding Nook of the
Snake to show contempt for you."</p>

<p>"Again I ask why do you say such things to
me?" There was so much reproach in the tones
of the voice of the Golden Hearted that the young
man hung his head and stammered:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, but I wanted you to know there
is danger for you here, and I am ready to serve you
faithfully."</p>

<p>The Golden Hearted made no reply, but taking
a thoroughly-dried cactus needle from a shelf,
stuck it through his ears and was beginning to
pierce his tongue when the young man sprang forward
and caught his hand.</p>

<p>"Why, good prince," he cried in a startled
voice, "do you maltreat your poor ears and tongue?
It is I who have spoken evil, not you."</p>

<p>"But I listened, and that is an offense against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
the Good Law. Do you think I will not punish
myself for disobedience?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the young man, with tears streaming
down his face, "the sight of blood makes my
heart ache, and I, too, will be punished." And with
that he stuck cactus needles through his ears and
tongue.</p>

<p>"My friend," said the Golden Hearted, "I
thank you for your kind thought of me, but I must
beautify Tulla even if it does displease the king,
and he is right in calling it the Hiding Nook of the
Snake, because it will be a treasure-house of the
wisdom inherited from the philosophers and wise
men of your race. You should always bear in mind
that a serpent is a symbol of wisdom, and not a
thing to despise. The king compliments me, even
though he knows it not."</p>

<p>The young man went out of the room with the
thorns still sticking in his ears, and when he spat
blood, his companions said:</p>

<p>"Why does your mouth bleed?" and he
answered:</p>

<p>"Because I have been speaking evil of some
one."</p>

<p>"Open your mouth and let us see," they said.</p>

<p>"It is only needful to examine the tongue. I
have pierced it with the sharp needle of the cactus."</p>

<p>"Who gave you leave to do such a thing?"</p>

<p>"No one," he answered, "but when the Good
Prince inflicted that penalty on himself for merely
hearing what I said, I could do no less than follow
his example."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>"And we will do likewise," they said, and in
after years, every devotee of the teachings of the
Golden Hearted punished himself in this manner
for evil speaking or listening to others saying
unkind things of a fellow creature.</p>

<p>Of course we know that the king really was
jealous of the Golden Hearted, and was determined
that he should not stay long in Tulla, which bade
fair to rival his own city with which it was connected
by the secret passageway containing the Dark
House. During the years of his absence, the wise
men left in Nachan had been at work on this wonderful
city, and it was very beautiful indeed, even
before the Golden Hearted saw it at all. When he
came the inhabitants received him with great
rejoicing, and then the king of Nachan began to be
afraid that he would have too great a following.</p>

<p>The king had no excuse to fight the Golden
Hearted, because he always put his fingers in his
ears when they talked of war in his presence, and
under no circumstances would he have been made
king himself. He only wanted to teach and help
the people in a peaceable and kind way.</p>

<p>The king knew all this, but he was uneasy and
wanted the Golden Hearted to go away. So he
hired a native wizard to play a cunning trick upon
the Golden Hearted. Disguising himself as one of
the wise men, the wizard went to his house and said
to his servant:</p>

<p>"I wish to see and speak to your master."</p>

<p>"Go away, old man, you cannot see the prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
for he is sick. You will annoy him and cause him
heaviness."</p>

<p>"But I must see him," persisted the pretended
old man.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment and I will ask him," said the
servant, and he went and told the Golden Hearted
that a strange old man was determined to see him.</p>

<p>"Let him come in," said the sick man.</p>

<p>Tottering up to the bedside as if he were very
feeble, the intruder said with well-feigned
sympathy:</p>

<p>"How are you, my lord? Here is a medicine I
have brought for you."</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig129" id="fig129"></a>
<img src="images/i_128.jpg" width="341" height="262" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"HERE IS MEDICINE FOR YOU"</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>"You are welcome; I have been expecting you
for many days," and the Golden Hearted held out
his hand in a friendly manner.</p>

<p>"How is your body, and how is your health?"
again asked the visitor, seating himself by the
bedside.</p>

<p>"I am exceedingly sick. All my body is in
pain, and I cannot move my hands nor my feet."</p>

<p>"The medicine I have is good and wholesome.
If you will drink it you will be healed and eased at
heart." As he said this, the wizard held up a small
silver cup and put a white powder in it. "Drink
this and you will then have in mind the toils and
fatigues of death, and of your departure."</p>

<p>"Where have I to go?" cried his listener in
surprise.</p>

<p>"To Tlapalla (which was their name for the
Happy Island), where The Old Man of the Sea is
waiting for you. He has much to tell you, and when
you return you will be young and handsome.
Indeed you will be a mere boy again." Seeing that
the Golden Hearted merely stared at him, he said:
"Sir, drink this medicine."</p>

<p>But the sick man did not wish to do so.</p>

<p>"Drink, my lord, or you will be sorry for it
hereafter," urged the wizard.</p>

<p>"No, no; I will not drink it."</p>

<p>"At least rub some on your brow and taste a
sip." So the Golden Hearted drank a little to try
it, saying:</p>

<p>"What is this? It seems to be a thing very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
good and savory. Already I feel myself healed. I
am well."</p>

<p>"Drink some more, my lord, since it is good.
The more you drink, the better you will feel."</p>

<p>The sick man swallowed considerable more
and then he was drunk. It was not medicine at all
that the wizard gave him, but a white wine made
from the maguey plant and the powder he put in it
was to make the Golden Hearted believe that he
must go away.</p>

<p>For days after he was very sad and wept continuously,
but he began to get ready to leave Tulla.
No matter what was said to dissuade him, he could
never get rid of the idea that he must take all of his
followers and go as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The wise men, seeing that he was determined,
gathered up all the picture writings they had made
as a record of their journeys, and putting them into
an ark, carried it swung on a pole with them.
Before leaving, they called the people together and
said:</p>

<p>"Know that the Golden Hearted commands
you to remain here in these lands of which he makes
you master and gives you possession. He goes to
the place whence he and we came, but he will return
to visit you when it shall be time for the world to
come to an end. You must await him in these lands,
possessing them and all contained in them since for
this purpose came we hither. Remain, therefore,
for we go with the Golden Hearted."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<h2>The Departure of the Golden
Hearted</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_131.jpg" style="margin-top: -5em" width="148" height="179" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE poisoned wine worked in the
brain of the Golden Hearted
and caused him to do many
singular things. For instance he
burned all the beautiful houses built
for him by the wise men and ordered
much of his treasure to be buried in
the mountains and ravines. When he
left Tulla, he took all the bright-plumaged singing
birds with him, and would only allow nineteen of
the wise men to go with him.</p>

<p>Two of these knew all about fishing, and two
knew about farming, and one was a weather prophet
who studied the clouds and winds, and could foretell
storms, while all the rest were priests who kindled
the sacred fires and taught the people the Good
Law.</p>

<p>As soon as the King of Tulla found he was
leaving, he took an army and followed after him,
laying the country waste and taking captive as
many of the people as he could find.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>"Good prince, why do you not let us make war
upon your and our enemy?" the warriors often
asked him, but he always put his fingers in his ears
and replied sadly:</p>

<p>"You do not understand the Good Law, my
friend. The only way to overcome hate is with
love. It is fully time for me to return to Tlapalla."</p>

<p>He traveled on until he came to a place where
there was a great tree, high and very thick. Here
he sat down to rest.</p>

<p>"Bring me a mirror," he said to his servant,
and when he saw his face reflected in it, he cried
out:</p>

<p>"Take it away. I am already old." Then the
wise men knew that the drug in the wine was making
him mad again and they did not try to hinder
him when he began throwing stones at the tree.</p>

<p>"I will make these stones stick into your bark
until you look like a porcupine and the wind cannot
blow them out," he said, and for a long, long time,
the tree was pointed out to travelers as being
enchanted, because the god of wind had hurled his
wrathful breath upon it. From all accounts the
tree was full of sharp rocks from top to bottom and
must have looked very queer indeed.</p>

<p>The flute players tried to divert his attention
as they marched along the wood, but he was very
weary and finally sat down to rest on a stone by the
roadside.</p>

<p>"O, Thou of infinite mercy and compassion,
dry the hot tears that flood and burn my face," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
said brokenly as he looked toward Tulla. People
now say that his tears marked and ate into the
stone, and that the print of his hands is still to be
found on it.</p>

<p>After he had reached a very wide river and
had commanded his followers to help build a bridge
across it, he was met by some men who tried to stop
him.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" they asked, "and
why do you leave your city? To whose care will
you commend it, and who will do penance in it?"
The Golden Hearted answered them firmly:</p>

<p>"You can in no wise hinder me, for I must go."</p>

<p>"But where are you going?" they insisted.</p>

<p>"To Tlapalla," he answered.</p>

<p>"For what purpose are you going?"</p>

<p>"The sun calls me," he said.</p>

<p>"Go then," they replied, "but leave behind all
the mechanical arts, the melting of silver, the
working of precious stones and of masonry,
picture writing, feather work and other crafts."
And then they would have robbed him, but he
threw all his rich jewels into a fountain. Among
his tormentors was the pretended old wizard who
tried to induce him to drink more wine.</p>

<p>"No, I can not drink it. I can not even taste
it again," he said, and that night in his sleep he
turned his head from side to side and tore his hair
with his hands.</p>

<p>The next morning in passing between a volcano
and the snowy mountain tops, all his servants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
being hunchbacked, died of cold, and he had no way
to get down the steep mountain side except to slide
in a squatting position with his feet close together.</p>

<p>In one place he stopped and built a square
stone court for ball play, and taught the people how
to play the game. Now it is said that he drew a line
through the center of the court, and that made the
deep gash in the mountains still to be seen.</p>

<p>In another place he threw a dart at a tree and
pierced it in such a manner that it looked like a
cross, and after that a cross was called "The Tree
of Our Life," in memory of this event. Some say
that he built houses with certain underground
passageways where he hid picture writing and
records of his teachings, and just before arriving
at the water's edge, he set up and balanced a great
stone so that it could be moved with one's little
finger, but a whole multitude could not displace it.</p>

<p>No doubt you remember the village chief where
the Golden Hearted went when he first arrived from
the Happy Island, and also that he sent this chief
a cross with a hand in the center. Now that he
was going home again, the Golden Hearted thought
he would visit the chief and see how he and his
people were progressing.</p>

<p>Imagine his surprise in finding that they had
dedicated a temple to him, and that in the middle
of the square tower was a terra cotta statue of himself
dressed as a warrior holding an arrow in his
hand, and because the statue was hollow they
thought it was an oracle. His name in their language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
was Cukulcan, but the common people called
him "The Working Hand," and had great respect
for a huge stone cross erected in the turreted courtyard
in front of the temple, which had a big red
hand in the center.</p>

<p>When the Golden Hearted went among the people,
he found that they remembered everything he
had told them, and that on the anniversary of his
coming great crowds of people came on a pilgrimage
to the oracle statue in the temple. It did no
good for him to tell them that he was simply an
elder brother and teacher come to give them aid in
a simple, kindly way. They believed he was sent
by God, and for ages after the people made pilgrimages
to this shrine, and held it in very great
esteem.</p>

<p>Realizing that it was time for him to go down
to the sea coast among the fishermen he had first
seen, he went to the temple service one morning,
and after praying before the altar, picked up a
sacred Tunkel and sang them a prophetic song of
farewell:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Ye men of Itza hearken to the tidings</p>
<p>Listen to the forecast of this cycle's end,</p>
<p>Four have been the ages of the world's progressing</p>
<p>Now the fourth is ending and its end is near,</p>
<p>A mighty lord is coming, see you give him honor,</p>
<p>A potent lord approaches to whom all must bow</p>
<p>I, the prophet, warn you, keep in mind my boding,</p>
<p>Men of Itza mark it, and await your lord."</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>"Waste not your time in idle repining," he
said in farewell, "I go for purification, but will
surely come again."</p>

<p>He only spent time enough on the seashore to
build and provision a balsa, or boat with sails, and
then he said "good bye" to the fisherfolk, and
sailed away toward the east with a few of the wise
men for companions. Just before he stepped into
the boat he turned to the wise men, who were to
remain and said:</p>

<p>"It wrings my heart to part from you, but
there is need for you to stay here in order to complete
the tasks already begun." As he embraced
and kissed each one on the cheek he named their
special duty, and had no fear that his orders would
not be fully carried out.</p>

<p>"You must go to the son of Guatamo, and tell
him my work is finished."</p>

<p>To another he said:</p>

<p>"You must go about and teach in my stead.
I will come again, but at another time."</p>

<p>It was difficult for him to persuade the fisherman
not to accompany him.</p>

<p>"Have no fear. Mine is a staunch bark capable
of riding the storm and stress of the angry sea.
Farewell, beloved, I will return to you, when the
time and seasons are propitious."</p>

<p>The people on shore turned again and again
to throw kisses to him, while the fishermen in their
little boats put out to sea with him, and strained
their vision to catch a last glimpse of his flower-laden
balsa.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>The wise men and priests in the temples where-ever
he had been, began at once to guard the sacred
fires and to watch and pray for his safe return.
Lest they should forget his sayings they engraved
them on stone, and taught them to the people so
that his name was a household word for generations.
His was the only civilization known in the
Americas before the advent of the white men.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WE have read somewhere that "in 1492
Columbus sailed the waters blue," and we
know that the big Exposition held in Chicago
in 1893 was to commemorate the four hundredth
anniversary of the discovery of America,
but no one can possibly tell how long it was after
the Golden Hearted sailed away, until Columbus
came.</p>

<p>And nobody knows where the Golden Hearted
went.</p>

<p>He said he was going to Tlapalla, which we
know meant the Happy Island, but no one can find
it any more, and there are traditions which say that
the island, with all its inhabitants, sank in the
ocean. This may be why the Golden Hearted never
came back again. Of course the wise men and the
primitive people in the Americas believed that
he would return because he said he would, and
they watched and waited all the long years from
one generation to another. Many times bright and
promising young men, just out of the universities,
or fresh from victories on the battle fields, would
take the vows of a priest, and give up all their hopes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
and ambitions to serve in the temples erected in
honor of the Golden Hearted. They did not know
anything more about him than we do, but they had
faith in him.</p>

<p>They said:</p>

<p>"All the good we know comes from him, and
when he returns all wrongs will be righted and
every heart made to rejoice. He will give us everything
we wish for."</p>

<p>Several times during the year whole nations
would fast and do severe penance to induce him
to come quickly. Not one of them could be made
to believe that he was dead.</p>

<p>"No, no," they said, "he is asleep in the bosom
of the sun. He will surely come again; he promised
us he would."</p>

<p>Then they would get the idea that he was
offended, and the kings would order great sacrifice
to be made to appease him. In some places I am
sorry to say they offered the quivering, bleeding
hearts of human beings by the hundreds, but still
he did not come. In other places they remembered
his gentleness and only laid fruit, flowers and perfumes
on the sacred fire altars which they still kept
burning. There were many places where they carefully
preserved his sayings by cutting them in sign
language on the stones of the temples, and every
child was taught to imitate his virtues and follow
his example.</p>

<p>For several years before Columbus arrived
the priests and wise men had been prophesying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
that the Golden Hearted was soon to return, that
the sun was bringing him back, accompanied by
companions like himself, who would rule over them.
Not even the great-great-grandfathers of the men
then living had seen the Golden Hearted, so they
did not know how he looked, but their traditions
said that he was a bearded white man, and we shall
see by and by what a curious mistake this led them
to make about the first white men who came to them
after the discovery of America.</p>

<p>Before we can understand how such things
could happen, we must remember that the people in
Europe did not know there was an America, and
that many of them had very queer ideas about the
shape of the earth. Some said it was four-cornered
and square like a dry goods box, and others thought
it was round and flat like a plate, surrounded by
water which finally changed into vapor and mist,
and that whoever ventured far out into the misty
clouds fell through and went&mdash;heaven knows where!</p>

<p>In the quaint old Italian city of Genoa was
born a little boy named Christopher Columbus, who
was to change all this, and be the innocent cause of
much suffering to the descendants of the races who
had been visited by the Golden Hearted. When a
mere lad at school, he was greatly interested in
boats, and he not only studied geography and history,
but read all the books of travel he could find,
and dreamed night and day of a great long voyage
he was going to make on the ocean some time. He did
not waste his time fishing and playing on the beach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
like other boys, but picked up the chips that washed
ashore and examined them very carefully, because
he believed that if there was an unknown land some
where in the west, that the waves would bring something
ashore from there. He was really quite an old
man before he found anything, but one day he
picked up some strange chips at Cadiz that had been
cut by hand, and then he knew he was right.</p>

<p>Sailors always do have wonderful tales to tell
about the sea, and in those days they were so superstitious
that they were sure that there were huge
monsters living in the distant waters just waiting
to eat up any sailor foolish enough to venture near
them. There was not one of them willing to listen
to Columbus, when he tried to explain that the
earth is round like an orange, and that we live on
the outside of it. He said to them repeatedly:</p>

<p>"If we sail west steadily, we shall in time
arrive back at the place from which we started."
Finally, not only the sailors, but the people in the
streets pointed their fingers at him and said:</p>

<p>"There goes the crazy old man, who thinks the
world is as round as an apple."</p>

<p>The more he talked and reasoned and argued
and even drew maps to prove that he was right,
the more everybody shook their heads and called
him crazy.</p>

<p>Columbus was about to give up in despair
because he was very poor, and there seemed to be
no way by which he could demonstrate that his
theory of the shape of the earth was correct.</p>

<p>And now comes a curious coincidence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>He was a very devout Christian, and felt certain
that the inhabitants of this strange country
in the west had never heard of our God nor of his
beloved son Jesus, and his heart was fired with zeal
to reach these poor heathens and tell them the story
of the Christ.</p>

<p>About this time some influential friend secured
an audience for him with the King of Portugal, but
it did no good to tell his story to the rich monarch,
who was neither of a scientific nor a religious turn of
mind, and he might as well have talked to the wind.
Utterly discouraged Columbus decided to go to
Spain, which is a near neighbor of Portugal, and
see if he could not induce the famous King Ferdinand
and Isabella, the queen, to give him boats
to make his longed-for voyage. The queen especially
was very pious and was much interested in
Columbus' story about the heathens, but the ministers
of her court laughed at Columbus and said:</p>

<p>"It is a foolish dream which can never be
carried out."</p>

<p>Almost heart-broken Columbus silently turned
his back on the Spanish capital and walked a long
way to a seaport called Palos, where there was a
queer old convent in which strangers were made
welcome by the kind monks living in it. Knocking
upon the gate, he said to the porter:</p>

<p>"Will you please give me a bit of bread and a
drink of water."</p>

<p>Fortunately, the prior, a learned man and an
intimate friend of Queen Isabella came along, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
was quick to see that Columbus was no common
beggar. He invited him in, and after listening quietly
and thoughtfully to his visitor's plan of crossing
the ocean to convert the heathen to Christianity,
he borrowed a mule and rode miles across the
country to the castle where the Queen was staying
and persuaded her to help Columbus.</p>

<p>"It is your duty," he said. "God has given
you riches and many blessings that you may
assist your fellow men, and these strange people
know nothing of our God, and they need teachers
to help them find the right way of living."</p>

<p>Queen Isabella was so impressed with what
he said that she immediately petitioned the Royal
Treasurer to give Columbus money to make his
voyage of discovery.</p>

<p>"Your majesty, there is no money to spare,"
was the polite answer of the Treasurer, who, like
all the rest of the court, thought Columbus was a
visionary dreamer if not crazy.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said. "I will pawn my
crown jewels," and she did. This was a most noble
and courageous act on her part, for a queen in
those days was scarcely considered dignified or
respectable without splendid crown jewels to wear
on public occasions, but she was bent upon sending
the gospel of Christ to the heathen in America. Does
it not seem strange that the Golden Hearted and
the Queen of Spain should be credited with the
same desire to help the people of the Americas,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
and that they lived hundreds of years apart and
could never have known of each other, and that one
incident is a fact of history and the other only a
legend?</p>

<p>But as soon as Columbus secured the money
another difficulty arose. No sailor could be found
who would risk his life on an unknown sea with
such a crazy old man. Finally Queen Isabella had
to promise liberty and full pardon to the convicts
in the prisons before Columbus could get any one
to go with him. It was a terrible thing for him
but he had a brave heart, and the monks from the
convent at Palos sent some of their number with
him to teach the natives.</p>

<p>On and on, the three caravels, the Santa Maria,
the Pinta and Nina, sailed without finding land,
until their provisions were getting low and the
crews of convicts were about to mutiny and kill
Columbus. In order to keep them quiet he told them
wonderful stories of the riches of this land they
were trying to find.</p>

<p>"You can have all the gold, and silver, and
precious gems you can carry," he promised them.
In an instant you could see the cunning and greed
in their wicked faces. They did not care whether
the earth was round or flat, nor what became of the
natives, if they only had gold, and then they would
gather around Columbus and question him closely
about the size of the nuggets and precious stones.
Of course he could only guess at it, but he knew
that to save his life he must say something, so he
replied:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>"I firmly believe that there are immense pieces
of solid gold to be found there, and that it is
abundant."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig147" id="fig147"></a>
<img src="images/i_146.jpg" width="462" height="344" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"ON AND ON THE THREE CARAVELS SAILED."<br />
See <a href="#Page_146">opposite page</a></p>
</div>

<p>Some thought they would find it in lumps as
big as a house, and they all expected to pick up
hands full of gems just anywhere. Columbus had
strained his eyes looking for the land until he was
nearly blind, but one night he imagined he saw a
glimmer of light ahead. Where there was light
there must be land, he thought. So he called one
of the sailors to him and asked him what he saw.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig148" id="fig148"></a>
<img src="images/i_147.jpg" width="343" height="253" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"LAND! LAND AHEAD!"</p>
</div>

<p>"A light! a light!" cried the sailor joyfully.
But it was not until nearly two o'clock in the morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
that the commander of one of the other boats
started the cry:</p>

<p>"Land! Land ahead!"</p>

<p>You can imagine what excitement there was
on all the caravels, and how thankful Columbus
was. The padres gathered around him, and as he
sprang ashore, he dropped on his knees and stooped
and kissed the ground. Even the sailors forgot
about the gold while he and the padres prayed and
thanked God for giving mankind a new world.</p>

<p>Immediately the flag of Spain was planted and
the land claimed for King Ferdinand and Isabella,
but wonderful indeed were the things surrounding
them. Men and women of a bronze color crowded
around them and offered them strange, but delicious
fruits and flowers and brought them food and
water. In his first letter to Queen Isabella, Columbus
said of them:</p>

<p>"There is not in all the world a better people
nor a better land. Their converse is ever sweet
and gentle, and is accompanied by a smile. They
truly love their neighbor as themselves."</p>

<p>Finding them docile and kind the padres set
about teaching them, and the simple natives were
very willing listeners. It was quite a long time
before they could understand each other well, but
the padres told the story of the Christ the first time
they held a service, which was on a Sunday.
Remembering the precepts of the Golden Hearted,
the faces of the natives lighted up understandingly
when they heard the words of Jesus which bade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
them be loving and kind to each other, and they
nodded their heads and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"El Dorado! El Dorado!"</p>

<p>At least that is what the ignorant convict sailors
thought they said. The words "El Dorado"
in Spanish, which was their mother tongue, meant
"The Golden," or "The Gilded One." We know
they were eager and greedy to find gold and
that they had been told to help themselves freely
to all they could get, so they immediately began
to question the simple natives.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; we have plenty of gold," the natives
said, in surprise, because they did not value it at
all, except for ornaments, and they ran to fetch
some for their visitors. When they saw how glad
it made the sailors, they were happy and content
as a lot of children, and they not only brought all
they had, but told where there was plenty more to
be found.</p>

<h2>"Bimini, the Fountain of Youth"</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_150.jpg" width="64" height="64" alt="W" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Columbus sailed back to Spain and
told the story of his wonderful discoveries
the people did not believe him at
first, but when he showed them the gold
and silver ornaments, and the strange
red men, they were so amazed that they forgot
even to ask questions.</p>

<p>The news was so startling that it simply took
their breath away and they stared at each other
stupidly. Then they said in awe-stricken whispers:</p>

<p>"How can such things be? Is the world coming
to an end? Are we going to die? Or are <i>we</i>
crazy? Maybe our ears and eyes are fooling us."</p>

<p>But Columbus only smiled and said:</p>

<p>"My friends, you see I was right. The earth
is round, and I have not only found India with its
untold riches, but I have brought some of its people
home with me."</p>

<p>And that is why today we call the red men
Indians. Columbus did not know that he had discovered
a new continent, so it was natural for him
to speak of the natives as Indians. And I am sure
you will pity him when I tell you that he died without
ever knowing the difference.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>All Europe was in a fever of excitement over
his voyage, and it was not long before he fitted out
other vessels and sailed across the ocean again to
find the northwest passage which he believed would
shorten the route to India. Rich men, and learned
ones, were ready to go with him, and the sailors
expected to find gold and precious stones scattered
all over the ground. Every word that the convicts
told them about El Dorado they thought meant
gold, and the wildest and most exaggerated stories
were soon in everybody's mouth.</p>

<p>The padres, too, were enthusiastic over the
prospect of converting the heathen, but nobody
took the trouble to find out what the Indians
believed about God. Every one misunderstood the
meaning of El Dorado and never dreamed that there
had been such a teacher as the Golden Hearted,
or that the Indians already knew how to be brotherly
and kind.</p>

<p>Even the most learned men in those days were
ready to accept the existence of a mythical city
called Cathay as true.</p>

<p>They thought it was situated somewhere
between the island of Newfoundland and Florida,
where they expected to find the spice groves.
Another story very common in Europe said that
there was among the beautiful summer isles of the
west, one that conferred immortality and was spoken
of as the Island of Perpetual Youth. Among those
whose imagination was fired by this romance was a
brave knight named Ponce de Leon, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Columbus' companion on his second voyage. He
did not care for the gold of the new world, for he
was already rich, but he was old, and he wanted
to renew his youth. King Ferdinand commissioned
him Governor of Porto Rico, but he soon tired of
it, and was determined to discover the magic
spring.</p>

<p>"For what reason should I stay here and lord
it over these half-naked savages," he said to his
relatives and friends when they tried to dissuade
him from undertaking such a perilous search. "Let
us go where we can bathe in those enchanted waters
and be young once more. I need it and so will you
before very long."</p>

<p>"But how do you know there is such a place?"
they asked.</p>

<p>"By hearing the full particulars of an old
Indian who went there and washed himself and
drank from the spring until he was restored to
youth and vigor. Let us go and be like him."</p>

<p>To find this new marvel he set sail with three
brigantines, and the adventurers with him floated
over the summer sea, as men bent upon pleasure,
and to whom time was long and burdened with no
serious duties. They sailed from island to island
touching here and there as fancy led them. They
sought the safest and pleasantest coves, where the
shades were deepest in the noonday sun, and the
waters coolest; where the fruits were the sweetest,
the Indians most friendly and their women the
loveliest. At last they came to an inlet which led
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
invitingly up among wooded banks and flowering
valleys. Here the old knight said:</p>

<p>"Let us disembark and strike inland. My
heart tells me that we have found the Fountain of
Youth."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said his younger kinsman, "our
way lies by water."</p>

<p>"Then leave me here with my men," he
replied, and after an angry discussion five men,
long past middle age, and who had come with him
from Spain, were left on shore. The first thing
they did was to climb to the top of a hill and set up
a cross which they had brought with them. As soon
as it was in place they all removed their helmets
and prayed before it. One of the men said to him:</p>

<p>"The ground is pawed up as if cattle ranged
here, and this path has been trod by human feet."</p>

<p>"You are right," said Ponce de Leon, "lead
the way and we will follow."</p>

<p>Taking the path they met about fifty Indian
bowmen, who seemed to their startled vision like a
whole company of giants, but, who proved to be of
a very friendly disposition.</p>

<p>The grizzled old knights were anxious to
inquire about the fabled Fountain, so they gave the
Indians strings of gay-colored beads, and some
little bells. In return they received an arrow, as a
token of good will. After a long parley the bowmen
turned back to their huts. "We will bring you food
in the morning," they said, and at daybreak they
appeared again bringing plenty of fish, roots and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
fruits. When they saw that the men were chilly
from the cold night air, they said to each other:</p>

<p>"Let us carry our brothers to our homes where
they can get warm."</p>

<p>"But they will suffer on the way," said the
chief. "Go before us and build big fires and we
will stop at each one to rest our weary arms."</p>

<p>The Spanish knights did not know what to make
of this kind of treatment, but they offered no resistance
when the stalwart warriors took them on their
backs and started through the woods. The Indians
carried them very carefully, and at last set them
down before the doors of their huts where the
women brought them food and drink.</p>

<p>"I wonder what they intend to do with us,"
said the knights among themselves. On hearing
this remark Ponce de Leon replied:</p>

<p>"It is just possible that they will offer us
as a sacrifice, for it is quite plain that they think
we are supernatural beings."</p>

<p>"Let us get away from them as quickly as we
can," they said, fearing that something terrible
would happen.</p>

<p>"Before we go we must try to find out about
the magic spring we are seeking," replied Ponce
de Leon, unwilling to give up his project. It
required considerable time and patience to make
the Indians comprehend what he wanted, but they
stoutly maintained that they knew nothing about it.</p>

<p>"These redskins are cunning rascals, and will
not tell us where to find the Fountain of Youth,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
said Ponce de Leon, in explanation, after his fruitless
talk with them, "but God giving us strength we
will find it yet."</p>

<p>So they went slowly and carefully over the
whole country, stopping at each spring to take off
their clothes and jump into it, then they would
drink as much of the water as they could, and sit
down and wait to see if it would make them young
again. As they went farther away from the coast
the Indians became more and more friendly,
because they thought the white men had come from
Heaven.</p>

<p>"We must bring them food, build houses for
them and bear all their burdens," they said among
themselves. Some went out on the hills and killed
deer with their bows and arrows, while others killed
rabbits by going in a big wide circuit and then
gradually closing in on the game. When near
enough they knocked the rabbit on the head with
a wooden club as it ran by them.</p>

<p>"Breathe upon and bless our food," they said
to the knights, after giving them all they wanted for
themselves, "so that we may feel sure in our hearts
that you are pleased with us."</p>

<p>At first only the men made these requests, but
finally the women brought wild fruits and berries,
which they wanted the visitors to see and touch
before they would eat. All this was very troublesome
to the knights, but if they refused or acted as
if they were offended, the poor Indians were terrified,
and falling on their faces would cry out:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall die unless we have the favor of our
good and wise white brothers."</p>

<p>Farther on, the people did not venture to come
out in the paths and gather round them as the first
had done, but stayed meekly in their houses, sitting
with their faces turned to the wall, and with all
their property heaped up in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>"We could easily plunder and rob these simple
folk," said Ponce de Leon, "but I charge you on
your honor as knights to take nothing you do not
pay for."</p>

<p>In spite of this the natives loaded them with
valuable skins and other presents, and were eager
and willing to show all the springs and creeks in
their neighborhood.</p>

<p>"They pretend to know nothing of the miraculous
gifts of the Fountain of Youth, but their
own splendid endurance of heat and cold, and the
fatigues of travel show how perpetually young and
active they are. If their bodies were pierced
through with arrows they would soon recover.
They are trying to mislead us and conceal the
source of their strength, but we will soon find it,"
the Spanish knights said, and Ponce de Leon, their
leader, heartily agreed with them.</p>

<p>Never in the world had there been such a
strange journey undertaken by gray and careworn
men. On and on they went searching in the heart
of the woods for a fountain where they could renew
their youth. Yellow jasmine trailed in festoons
above their heads; wild roses grew at their feet;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
the air was sweet with the odor of pine, while long
gray moss hung from the branches of the live-oaks.</p>

<p>Finally they came to a spring which widened
into a natural basin and bubbled up in such a cool,
delicious manner, that Ponce de Leon plunged into
it with joy. Coming up on the bank to dress himself,
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It is enough. I have bathed in the Fountain
of Youth. See, I am young again."</p>

<p>His companions hastened to try it, and they
too said the same.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! hurrah! the Fountain of Youth has
been found! Let us make haste to tell the world
of your discovery."</p>

<p>But they were mistaken and had not counted
on what the Indians would do about it. When they
found that the white men wanted a boat to go down
the river they were eager to get it for them, but
when they understood that they were going away,
they wept bitterly, and tried every way to persuade
them to stay.</p>

<p>"No, we will not remain. This is Florida, the
land of flowers, and we are looking for Bimini, the
Fountain of Youth," said Ponce de Leon, firmly.
"Your people have misled us continually. Bimini
is an island and we are going to search until we
find it."</p>

<p>"And if you succeed will you return to us,"
asked an Indian chief eagerly. "You have the
secret of life and death in your hands, and have
already saved my wife and child. Stay and we will
serve you faithfully."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

See <a href="#Page_158">opposite page</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! my brothers, stay with us!" begged and
implored the Indians. Some of them clung to the
garments of the knights, and others were dragged
out of the boat by the determined natives. Finally
Ponce de Leon, grown tired of useless parley, said
angrily:</p>

<p>"I am old and weary and must soon die if I do
not find the waters which will renew my youth and
vigor. Your thickets and swamps are filled with
alligators and poisonous water snakes; the very air
is laden with deadly fevers, and never again will I
return to it."</p>

<p>As the canoe started down the river the Indians
wrung their hands and wailed loudly:</p>

<p>"Come back! come back!" But Ponce de Leon
stood up in the boat and shook his head, and made
them understand by signs that he would not do as
they wished. This made them all the more frantic
and one of the warriors, snatching up a poisoned
arrow, sped it with deadly aim. It went through
the thigh of the gallant old knight where he stood,
and it was not long until death ended his search for
the Fountain of Youth. Since then no one has ever
tried to locate this wonder-working fountain, but
philosophers say that it is in our own hearts and
that we find it when we realize that the soul never
dies, and is perpetually young because of its
immortality.

<p class="drop-cap">COLUMBUS died poor and in
prison because nobody was
interested in his effort to find
a northwest passage to India,
or cared whether the earth was
round or flat. They wanted gold, and
the stories of El Dorado told by the
ignorant sailors had more influence on
the people than anything Columbus
said or did.</p>

<p>"I have merely opened the gates
for others to enter," he exclaimed
bitterly, when he found himself
thwarted in all his plans, but there is
more honor accorded his memory than
to any of the others who came after him, and made
immense fortunes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>The same year that Queen Isabella died, a
young man, but nineteen years old, named Hernando
Cortez, sailed from Spain for Cuba. Already
there was quite a Spanish settlement on the island,
and when the Governor offered him a large tract of
land with Indian slaves to cultivate it, he answered
angrily:</p>

<p>"I came to get gold, not to till the soil like a
peasant."</p>

<p>He expected to find untold wealth locked up
in the unexplored regions of the new world, and
had no patience with any of the slower methods of
gaining riches. Instead of working he meant to
fight for what he wanted and we shall find when
we know more about him that he broke his word
to his king, the governor of Cuba, to his wife, to his
soldiers, and to every friend who served him. Yet
he was born a gentleman, handsome and well mannered,
but a greedy love of gold rendered him brutal
and treacherous to a degree.</p>

<p>In his company were gallant knights of chivalry,
servile retainers of the king, soldiers of fortune,
and bearded friars, who left behind them country,
home, family, friends and sweethearts, to seek El
Dorado, which to them meant simply gold. When
we study the history of the United States we shall
be surprised to find men like them in full armor
of steel, with lance, shield and helmet, mounted on
prancing steeds, caparisoned in gay colors, glittering
through the untracked wilderness of Florida,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Georgia, Alabama, and even as far west as Arizona,
always in search of El Dorado. And in every case
their greed for gold led to such bloodshed and violence,
that it makes the heart ache to think about it.</p>

<p>Not many years after Cortez landed in Cuba,
the Governor sent for him and said:</p>

<p>
"I have at last secured permission from the
king to explore the continent lying to the west, and
I desire you to take ships and soldiers and have
command of the expedition."
</p>

<p>Something in Cortez' manner excited the suspicion
of the Governor, but he said nothing until
he was ready to sail. Then he withdrew the commission,
and ordered Cortez to remain in Cuba.
Instead of obeying he stole away in the night, and
did not land until he came to the coast of Mexico,
close to the point from which the Golden Hearted
had sailed. His men were afraid to venture far
from shore, but he painted glowing pictures of the
gold they were to find, and said:</p>

<p>"I hold out to you a glorious prize, but it is
only to be won by incessant toil."</p>

<p>Then holding up a black velvet standard with
a red cross in the center, surrounded by flames of
blue and white, he continued:</p>

<p>
"Comrades, let us follow the cross, and under
this sign if we have faith, we shall conquer."</p>

<p>The
padres with them, who had come to minister to the
spiritual welfare of the cavaliers and soldiers, urged
them to go forward, saying:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>"We are in honor bound to carry the gospel to
these poor, ignorant heathens, and God has given
you the privilege of helping in this work."
</p>

<p>The Indians were friendly and when asked for
gold, answered:</p>

<p>"We on the sea coast have little, but in Tenochtitlan
there is a rich and powerful king named
Montezuma, who has much gold and other
treasures."</p>

<p>Around them were parched and sandy plains,
but on the march they soon came to "the land of
bread," as the Tlascallan country was called, and
here they heard of Cholula, the sacred city. When
they came in sight of it they exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It is the promised land!" and were amazed at
the splendor of the city, as well as the surrounding
country, where there were fields of maize,
vanilla, indigo, sugar cane, flowering cacao groves,
and banana trees in profusion. The streets of Cholula
were filled with a concourse of priests whom
Cortez mistook for beggars. They were holding a
religious festival in honor of Quetzalcoatl, which
was their name for the Golden Hearted, who had
now become the Fair God of tradition. Long had
they been expecting him to return to Cholula, and
because Cortez had a fair complexion, and was
accompanied by other white men they thought the
Golden Hearted had come at last. The people lined
the streets and roadways and not only wore garlands
of flowers on their heads, but tossed bouquets
to the soldiers, while the priests met them with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
music and swung incense up and down the cleanly-swept
streets they passed through.</p>

<p>"What is the will of Quetzalcoatl?" they asked
eagerly of Cortez.</p>

<p>"Do you come from Tlapalla?" they inquired
of his followers.</p>

<p>"No," they were answered, "but we have a
disease of the heart which only gold can cure."</p>

<p>Then the simple natives brought all the gold-dust
and little trinkets they could find and gave to
their visitors. Cortez thanked them, but said:</p>

<p>"This is not enough. We must have very much
more."</p>

<p>"Then you would better ask our friend and
ally, the great king, Montezuma. He has immense
stores of it."</p>

<p>"Where is this great king, and this city of
Tenochtitlan?"</p>

<p>"Farther to the west," they answered.</p>

<p>Shortly after this an embassy of nobles from
the court of Montezuma appeared with rich presents
and an invitation to Cortez to visit the king.
None of them had ever seen a white man before,
and they did not for a moment doubt that Cortez
was the Golden Hearted, returned to claim his own,
and they were very anxious to please him. Touching
his brass helmet one of them said timidly:</p>

<p>"It is very like that worn by Quetzalcoatl, and
I would like our king, Montezuma, to see it."</p>

<p>"Certainly," responded Cortez, "but bring it
back filled with gold." And they did. No one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
knows just why, but something made Cortez suspect
the gentle natives of treachery, and one morning
at daybreak he fell upon them in the market
place, and slew thousands of people, and then set
fire to the city. His rude soldiers went up on the
pyramid and threw down the statue of the Golden
Hearted, and erected a cross in its place. History
says that the Aztecs had long been offering the
hearts of human beings in sacrifice to the Golden
Hearted in Cholula, while in Tenochtitlan they had
set up an image of a terrible war god, and were
worshiping that more than the gentle, inoffensive
Golden Hearted. It was this disobedience which
made Montezuma fear that he was returning to take
vengeance.</p>

<p>One morning early the king went to see the
Paba, who had charge of the sacred fires on the
altars built by the Golden Hearted himself. The
chamber in the temple was square, with the ceiling
covered by a lattice work of shining white and
yellow metal which, at the intersections, was carved
to represent flowers set with jewels. All around
the walls were sculptured pictures of men. As the
king approached the Paba said:</p>

<p>"The gloomy clouds hanging overhead are not
darker than is the mood of Quetzalcoatl, but to the
poor Paba the voice of the king is ever welcome."</p>

<p>"Why should the mood of Quetzalcoatl be
dark? A new teocalli holds his image, and they
say he is happy and that he comes from the place of
sunrise with a canoe filled with blessings."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you remember, O king! that in some of
the underground chambers of this temple, besides
vast stores of wealth, there are prophecies to be
read?"</p>

<p>"I remember it well," said Montezuma.</p>

<p>"Give me leave, and I will show you the writing
from Quetzalcoatl himself."</p>

<p>Groping their way through the great underground
cavern, but dimly lighted, the Paba said:</p>

<p>"Son of a king, is your heart strong? The writing
begins here and continues around the wall."</p>

<p>"Read it," said Montezuma.</p>

<p>"The first is here on the north and represents
the ancient king on the march. You see him in the
midst of warriors who are dancing in honor of his
victories. Here we have the whole story of our
race."</p>

<p>"This was before the coming of Quetzalcoatl
and is of the remote past," said Montezuma, with a
frown.</p>

<p>"On the southern wall, opposite," replied the
Paba, "is what you seek. Observe the king stands
on a rock, and a priest points out to him an eagle
on a cactus holding a serpent in its claws. Beside
it the king reclines on a couch. Our city has been
founded."</p>

<p>Montezuma said not a word, but turned to
another panel.</p>

<p>"Look well to this, O king! There is Quetzalcoatl
before an altar offering a sacrifice of fruit
and flowers. <i>His hands are free from blood!</i>"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<p>Montezuma's face was deadly pale, because he
knew that many orders of priests in his kingdom
sacrificed human beings by cutting out their hearts,
and he was afraid that the coming of the strange
white men was on account of this forbidden
practice.</p>

<p>"See! Oh majesty! the fair god is departing
from our beloved Tenochtitlan. Saddest of all
days was that for us."</p>

<p>"Show me a prophecy if you would have me
believe that this was written by Quetzalcoatl. I
would know something of the future."</p>

<p>"Be wise, oh my master! Let the future
alone; it is sown with sorrows for all you love."</p>

<p>"Until I wrong the gods why should I fear
them? Have done, Paba. I, too, am a priest,"
said Montezuma, earnestly.</p>

<p>"I, his true servant, tell you never again to
look for smile from Tlapalla. I will show you
from Quetzalcoatl himself, that the end of your
empire is at hand. Every breeze from the east
is filled with woe for you and yours. The writing
is on the wall. Look again and closely."</p>

<p>"I see nothing," cried the king.</p>

<p>"All that you have heard about the return
of Quetzalcoatl is true. He is coming to end the
days of the Aztecs forever."</p>

<p>"Forever! It cannot be. Read the next
panel."</p>

<p>"There is no other, this is the last," answered
the Paba sadly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>Montezuma turned quickly to the north wall,
but found it without a single mark. Here indeed
was the end.</p>

<p>That night the Aztec king could neither eat nor
sleep. The prophecy was with him all the time.
When the morning came he called for his canoe.
From the battlements of Chapultepec, the palace
and tomb of his fathers, he would see the sun rise.
If Quetzalcoatl was angered and meant to wreak
vengeance, he naturally supposed the sun, his
dwelling place, would give some warning.</p>

<p>In all the heavens around there was not a
fleck when suddenly a cloud of smoke rushed
upward, and across the pathway of the sun, so that
when it crept over the mountain range, it looked
like a ball of blood! Montezuma drew the hood
over his face quickly, and his head dropped on his
breast.</p>

<p>The Paba had spoken the truth. Quetzalcoatl
was coming! and next evening a runner sped hotly
over the causeway and up the street, stopping at
the gate of the royal palace. He was taken before
the king and shortly after the news went flying over
Tenochtitlan, that Quetzalcoatl had arrived in his
huge water-house with wings, and filled with
thunder and lightning! for that was what the
Aztecs called the ships and cannon brought by
Cortez.</p>

<p>When Montezuma heard of the terrible massacre
in Cholula, he called a council of wise old
men and said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>"Of what use is it, uncles? The gods are
against us and resistance is of no avail. I mourn
most for the women and children, and the old and
infirm who are too feeble to fight or fly. For myself
and the brave men around me, we must bare our
breasts to the storm and meet it as we may."</p>

<p>As Cortez neared Tenochtitlan he was met by
so many chiefs and nobles under Montezuma, that
it took them an hour to pass before him, and make
their salutation which they did by touching the
ground with the right hand and then carrying it
to the forehead. The four nobles carrying Montezuma
on their shoulders, were preceded by three
officers of state bearing gold wands in their hands
to show that they came in peace. The royal palanquin,
or chair, in which Montezuma was seated,
blazed with gold, jewels and gaudy feather-work,
while the nobles carrying it were barefooted.
They walked with slow measured steps and kept
their eyes bent on the ground. Finally the train
of warriors and nobles halted, and Montezuma
came forward to meet Cortez.</p>

<p>Imagine what their feelings must have been
as they looked at each other! Montezuma thought
he was welcoming back the gentle, kind Quetzalcoatl,
whom we know as the Golden Hearted, while
Cortez knew he had found more gold and riches
than he ever dreamed existed anywhere.</p>

<p>The poor misled Aztec king approached the
Spanish adventurer and putting an exquisitely
wrought gold collar around his neck said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>"This was my father's palace but it belongs
to you and your brethren. Rest here after your
fatigues and in a little while I will visit you
again."</p>

<p>When he went out of the palace he sent slaves
to wait upon them, and he gave each one new
clothes, and a splendid feast. When they had
finished eating, the rude soldiers searched all
through the palace for hidden wealth, and finding
the treasure house of the king proceeded to help
themselves. When Montezuma heard of it he said:</p>

<p>
"They are welcome to the gold and silver and
other articles, if they will but spare the things
belonging to the gods."
</p>

<p>In the palace grounds where they were
quartered they found an aviary filled with beautiful
singing birds; a menagerie full of strange animals,
and snakes; ten big tanks stocked with water-fowl
and fish; fountains playing everywhere, and
wonderful floating gardens on the lakes, while all
around them lay a city filled with temples, market
places, and handsome houses.</p>

<p>True to his promise Montezuma returned
shortly and in speaking to Cortez said:</p>

<p>"I have been expecting you for many days.
The wonderful deeds attributed to you, your complexion
and the quarter from whence you come
show me that you are Quetzalcoatl. You and
your brethren shall share all things with me," and
with tears in his eyes he gave them as many costly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
presents as they could carry. The padres and
soldiers were constantly asked:</p>

<p>"Do you come from Tlapalla?" while Montezuma
did everything he could to please Cortez.</p>

<p>One day he went to the king's palace and after
accepting the usual presents of gold and silver,
Montezuma offered him one of his daughters for
a wife. Cortez declined, and seeing that the courtyard
was partly filled with his trusted men, he
approached Montezuma abruptly and said:</p>

<p>
"You have treated me treacherously, and have
allowed one of my officers to be killed on the sea
coast."
</p>

<p>Montezuma turned very pale. No one else in
his kingdom would have dared speak to him in
such an insulting manner, and besides that he
knew nothing of the death of the officer before. In
reality the officer had been murdered while torturing
the poor natives to make them give him more
gold.</p>

<p>"I demand that you send for the chief and all
the notable men in his council that I may punish
him for the death of my comrade," said Cortez,
trying to pick a quarrel with the king.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Montezuma, kindly. "I
will have them brought as you desire."</p>

<p>"I believe in your promise, but you must come
to my quarters as hostage until the thing is done."</p>

<p>Poor Montezuma thinking it was a command
of God did not dare refuse, and in a short time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
afterward the chief and his council were brought
before him. He turned them over to Cortez for
punishment, and they were burned to death in the
public square, where Montezuma could see them
from his window. Cortez had the poor creatures
tortured to make them accuse Montezuma of telling
them to commit the murder, so that he would have
an excuse for what he intended to do to the king.
Pretending to believe the confessions, he went
before the king and ordered two common Spanish
soldiers to put him in irons. Poor Montezuma
moaned and groaned like his heart would break,
while his faithful attendants, weeping bitterly tried
to put their mantles under the irons so they would
not touch his flesh.</p>

<p>Cortez now demanded that he abdicate his
power, and pay tribute to Spain, so he compelled
the king to assemble all his chiefs, which he did
saying to them:</p>

<p>"You are acquainted with the traditions which
say that the good Quetzalcoatl is to return and rule
over us. That time has come and we must obey
our new masters. You have been faithful vassals
of mine, and I expect you to show me this last act
of obedience by acknowledging the great king
across the water as your lord also." The tears
streamed down his face, and his haughty chiefs
were very sad at heart, but they were loyal as well
as brave men, and they answered:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>"Your will is our law, and if you think the
king of the strangers is the ancient lord of our
country we are willing to acknowledge him as
such."</p>

<p>As soon as this was done the grasping Spaniards
compelled Montezuma to send throughout
his kingdom for all the gold, silver, precious stones
and feather-work that could be found, in the name
of the king of Spain, but when they got it they
divided it among themselves, and then quarreled
fiercely over who should have the greater part.</p>

<p>Here indeed was their fabled El Dorado!</p>

<p>There was but one more humiliation awaiting
Montezuma, and that was to have his own people
revile him. The Spaniards had been so brutal and
cruel in their dealings with the Aztecs that some of
them began to doubt whether they could have come
from Tlapalla, and whether Cortez was the Golden
Hearted. Knowing this Cortez induced Montezuma
to dress himself in his royal robes, and
appear on the stone parapet of the palace where he
was confined, to quiet the mob and induce them to
go about their work peaceably. Cortez was beginning
to fear for his own safety, but the populace
were not to be tricked by him. They did not believe
it was Montezuma before them, and hurling a stone
at the royal palanquin accidentally hit the unhappy
king on the forehead. The blow was not sufficient
to kill him, but he took to his bed and refused to
eat until he finally died. History says of him that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
"his great heart was burst in twain by the sorrows
that oppressed his high courage." Certain it is
that he could not live when he found that both his
God and his people despised him. It has never
been known what became of his body, for a terrible
war followed his death.</p>

<p>Today we call his country and city Mexico.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<h2>The Child of the Sun</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_175.jpg" style="margin-top: -8em" width="153" height="209" alt="N" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">NONE of us have forgotten about
the Children of the Sun, and the
city of Cuzco founded by the
Golden Hearted, or of his ruling
over them as Manco-Capac, the
powerful one. He went into
their country which we call Peru before he
had ever seen Mexico, but the Spaniards came
to the ancient city of Tenochtitlan before they
knew anything about Cuzco. It was not long after
the death of Montezuma until the Spaniards heard
about the riches of the Children of the Sun, and
they were determined to find that country.</p>

<p>The Aztecs did not help them any because they
no longer looked upon them as sent from Heaven
but as ruthless destroyers borne along on the backs
of fierce animals swift as the wind, and carrying
weapons in their hands that scattered death and
destruction everywhere. The Aztecs learned to
hate the Spaniards bitterly, and when we came to
study their history we shall know why. Even their
own historians do not pretend to deny that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
fell upon the poor Aztecs sword in hand and robbed
them of all the treasures they had, besides taking
their lands away from them.</p>

<p>Some say that Francisco Pizarro was a cousin
of Hernando Cortez who conquered the Aztecs,
but all agree that he was an ignorant swineherd,
who could neither read nor write, and whose
parents were not respectable. While he was not
actually a convict he belonged to the low class, and
the men going with him to search for the new El
Dorado among the Children of the Sun, were
really no better. Cortez had some hidalgoes, cavalliers
and knights with him because men of good
family often came to the Americas on the first voyages
after Columbus, but Pizarro collected a band
of cut-throat adventurers who were just as greedy
and ignorant as he was. All the exploring they
did was simply to search for gold, and they did not
care what methods they used to get it. The simple
natives with their naked defenseless bodies, and
bows and arrows were no match for men covered
with steel armor, mounted on horseback and armed
with guns and cannon. Balboa had already found
the Pacific Ocean, and Pizarro knew that the
Children of the Sun lived in that direction, so he
rigged out a vessel and sailed along the coast trying
to find them. At the first place he landed the
natives said to him:</p>

<p>"Why do you not stay at home and till your
own land instead of roaming about to rob others
who have never harmed you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>But the savages wore some heavy gold ornaments,
and Pizarro asked eagerly:</p>

<p>"Have you more of this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we have a little more," they said, and
as they were weighing some of the metal their chief
struck the scales with his fist, scattering the nuggets
all over the floor.</p>

<p>"If this is what you prize so much that you
are willing to risk your lives to attain it, I can tell
you of a land where they eat and drink out of
vessels of gold, and where there are great quantities
to be had for the asking."</p>

<p>"Where is this rich country?"</p>

<p>"It is ten days journey toward the south and
is ruled by the Child of the Sun."</p>

<p>The Spaniards were nearly mad with joy
because now they said:</p>

<p>"All our fond dreams are about to be realized."
They were in such a good humor that they
gave the natives some glass beads and some live
chickens. When they turned the rooster loose,
he crowed, and then the simple natives clapped
their hands in glee, and asked:</p>

<p>"What is it saying?"</p>

<p>It sounded as if the rooster said:</p>

<p>"How do you do, sir!" which the natives
thought was very funny indeed. Then they wanted
to know what the cannon said. One of the men
set up a target and fired at it shivering the board
into fine splinters. The loud noise, the flash of
smoke and powder, frightened the poor natives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
nearly to death. Some of them fell flat on their
faces, and others ran into the woods as fast as
they could go, screaming:</p>

<p>"Our good Manco-Capac is coming back to
us angry."</p>

<p>That night the old men huddled the terrified
people together and said to them:</p>

<p>"Do you remember when the comet flamed
through the sky; when the earthquake shook the
land, and there was a rainbow around the moon?"</p>

<p>"I well remember," said one of the old men,
"that a thunderbolt fell on one of the Incas' royal
palaces setting it on fire, and I saw an eagle chased
by several hawks hovering in the air over Cuzco.
Our king saw it too, and while he looked at it the
eagle fell dead at his feet."</p>

<p>"It is no use to resist these strangers," said
an envoy from the Inca, who had arrived in time
to hear the last statement. "Seven years ago when
the father of our king died, he called his son to his
bedside and told him that white and bearded
strangers were coming to overturn the Empire.
And as you know, our great oracle has foretold the
return of Manco-Capac at the close of the twelfth
dynasty of the Incas. That day is at hand, so do
not quarrel with the strangers."</p>

<p>No one showed a disposition to disobey him,
and in a short time he stood before Pizarro saying:</p>

<p>"I bring you greetings from the Inca, Child of
the Sun, who rules this land. He wishes me to ask
why you come, and from what country."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>"Our home is far across the sea," responded
Pizarro, "and we serve a rich and powerful prince
who has heard of the Child of the Sun, and sends
us to pay our respects to him."</p>

<p>This was not the truth for the King of Spain
knew nothing whatever of Pizarro's wicked intentions,
nor did he know about Cortez either until
long after poor Montezuma was dead and his
country laid waste. But when men turn out to
be wholesale robbers they do not care whether they
tell the truth or not.</p>

<p>"Our Inca is at his favorite baths and wishes
to know when you will arrive, so that he may provide
suitable refreshments for you."</p>

<p>"We will come at once," said Pizarro.</p>

<p>"It would be better to wait a few days," said
the king's messenger. "Our Inca is keeping a
sacred fast, and we cannot disturb him until it is
finished." The Spaniards had no respect for the
king's wishes or his privacy, so they made ready to
follow the messenger. While they were dividing
the presents of llamas, sheep and gold goblets
among themselves some of the soldiers said:</p>

<p>"This dog of a king may have thousands of
followers. What can a handful of men like we
are, do against so many? Suppose they should try
to fight us?"</p>

<p>Pizarro happened to overhear them and
replied:</p>

<p>"Let every one of you take heart, and go forward
like a good soldier. God ever protects his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
own, and will humble the pride of the heathen and
bring him to a knowledge of the true faith&mdash;the
great end and object of this conquest."</p>

<p>It was the first time he had spoken of conquest,
but the soldiers remembered the complete success
of Cortez in Mexico and only needed to be told that
the natives were to be Christianized to make them
certain that the home authorities would not interfere
with them, so they shouted:</p>

<p>"Lead on! wherever you think best we will
follow with good will."</p>

<p>The few padres in the company were sincere
in their wish to teach the natives and so was the
King of Spain, but neither of them could control the
actions of such men as Pizarro and his adventurers,
now ready to pounce down on the mild and inoffensive
people like a band of hungry wolves. When
they got up on the top of the mountain and looked
down, the landscape had the appearance of a huge
checker-board cut into squares by canals and evergreen
hedges. A wide river rolled through the
meadows, like a narrow silver ribbon, while across
the valley were the famous hot baths with steam
and vapor rising from them in the clear air. Along
the slope of the hills a white cloud of tents covered
the ground for several miles, where the Child of the
Sun, and his court were encamped.</p>

<p>Pizarro with banners streaming and the
sparkle of armor glittering in the sun, galloped
into the city with blare of trumpets and lances
fixed. The Inca was in a camp near by, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
rude Spaniards broke in upon his fast, and a
brother of Pizarro almost rode him down with his
horse. Giving the bridle a sudden jerk he brought
the horse to his haunches, so close to the Inca, that
the horse snorted with fear, but the brave king did
not move a muscle, although he had never seen a
white man in armor nor a horse before in his life.
Seeing that he could not frighten him Pizarro's
brother said haughtily:</p>

<p>"What is your royal will? My brother desires
that you visit him."</p>

<p>Without raising his eyes from the ground
where he had kept them as a mark of respect to his
visitor, the Inca smiled and said:</p>

<p>"Tell your captain, that I am keeping a fast,
which will end tomorrow morning. I will then
visit him with my chieftains. In the meantime let
him occupy the public buildings on the square till I
come, when I will order what is to be done."</p>

<p>Turning to his attendants he continued:</p>

<p>"Give our brothers food and drink, and have
their quarters made ready for them."</p>

<p>That night Pizarro put all his cannon in place
and boldly planned to take the Inca prisoner in
his own pleasure garden. He ordered his soldiers
to hide in the plaza, and wait until the Inca arrived.
As soon as he was in the great square they were
suddenly to spring out and put the natives to the
sword, and capture their king.</p>

<p>It was late in the day before the Inca got all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
his court in splendid array, and then he sent word
to Pizarro that he was coming in state.</p>

<p>"I am much pleased to hear it," said Pizarro.
"Let your king come anyway he will; he shall be
received as a friend and brother. Let him sup
with us and sleep in our quarters tonight."</p>

<p>When once in motion the Inca's retinue had
on so many gold ornaments that they blazed like
the sun. Some wore showy stuffs in white and red
with gold and silver embroidery, while others were
dressed in white and carried silver maces in their
hands. The Inca wore the royal borla, or crown
on his head, with the Quetzal feathers in the back
and the long red fringes across the forehead. Over
him was a canopy representing a rainbow, to show
that he was a Child of the Sun, and a follower of
Manco-Capac, who we know was the Golden
Hearted. He was seated on a gold throne which
was placed in a litter and carried by four noble
youths, in gorgeous liveries. Around his neck was
a splendid gold necklace set with large emeralds.
Looking around and not seeing any one the Inca
asked in surprise:</p>

<p>"Where are the strangers?"</p>

<p>At this moment a padre came forward and
demanded that he give up his power and become a
subject of Spain. He also told the king that he
must become a convert to Christianity. The eyes
of the Inca flashed fire as he replied:</p>

<p>"I will be no man's tributary. Your prince
may be great; I do not doubt it when I see that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
has sent his subjects so far across the waters. I
am willing to hold him as a brother. As for my
faith, I will not change it. My God still lives in
the heavens and looks down on his children. By
what authority do you make such demands upon
me?"</p>

<p>The padre handed the Inca a bible but as the
thought of the insult offered came over him, the
Inca threw it to the ground and said angrily:</p>

<p>"Tell your comrades that they shall give me
an account of their doings in my country. I will
not go from here until they have made me full
satisfaction for the wrongs they have committed."</p>

<p>A soldier turned to Pizarro and said:</p>

<p>"Do you not see that while we stand here
wasting our breath in talking to this dog full of
obstinate pride that the fields are filling with
Indians. Let us set on at once."</p>

<p>Pizarro saw that the hour had come, and
waving a white scarf which was the appointed
signal he and his soldiers sprang into the square,
shouting the old war cry of Cortez:</p>

<p>"Santiago! and at them!"</p>

<p>The poor natives in their holiday dress and
fine jewelry were wholly unarmed, because they
were coming to make a visit, and had no way to
defend themselves. When they tried to escape they
found they were hemmed in on all sides by the stone
buildings facing the plaza, and nobody knows how
many thousands of them were killed. They were
stunned by the roar of the cannon, choked by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
smoke, trampled under the horses' feet, and their
naked bodies hacked to pieces with swords.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig185" id="fig185"></a>
<img src="images/i_184.jpg" width="345" height="453" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"THEIR NAKED BODIES HACKED TO PIECES WITH SWORDS"<br />
See <a href="#Page_186">next page</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Spaniards seemed bent upon killing the
Inca, but his loyal subjects caught hold of the horses'
bridles and saddle blankets, and even the legs of
their riders to prevent them from hitting the Inca.
Some offered their own bodies to the lances&mdash;anything
to save the king who was stunned and
bewildered. As the men who were carrying him
were killed, the litter lurched to one side and he
fell to the ground. Instantly the imperial borla,
or crown, was snatched from his head; his hands
were securely tied, and he was hustled, a prisoner,
into a building nearby. Then the soldiery robbed
and pillaged as much as they pleased, even carrying
off the plate from the Inca's table.</p>

<p>Realizing that it was gold that the Spaniards
wanted, the Inca began at once to try to buy his
freedom.</p>

<p>"I will cover the floor of this room with gold
if you will release me," he said, to Pizarro. Seeing
that the soldiers smiled at this, he added:</p>

<p>"I will fill the room full, as high as I can
reach," standing on tip-toe and stretching his arm
against the wall. Pizarro agreed to accept that
amount of gold, but demanded double that amount
of silver, and would only allow the Inca two
months' time to collect it in. The Spaniards kept
close watch over him, and as soon as the amount
was all paid in, Pizarro accused the unhappy captive
of trying to stir up an insurrection. The Inca
was surprised and indignant; saying:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>"You have me in your power. Is not my life
at your disposal? What better security have you
for my fidelity? It is very far to my capital at
Cuzco, but that you may be satisfied that I am proceeding
in good faith, send some of your own people
there."</p>

<p>The Spaniards sacked and pillaged Cuzco when
they got there, taking seven hundred plates of gold
from the walls of the temple dedicated to the
Golden Hearted. Besides this, there were heavy
cornices of gold, fountains, birds, fruit, vegetables,
tables, statues, slabs, basins and panels of pure
gold; which, when melted down made millions of
dollars.</p>

<p>Never before did anybody in the wide world
pay such a ransom. But Pizarro had no intention
of setting the Inca free. Pretending to be very suspicious,
he suddenly appeared before the Inca, and
said:</p>

<p>"What new treason is this you are meditating
against me? <i>Me</i>, who has been so brotherly and
kind to you?"</p>

<p>"Why do you mock me," replied the Inca.
"Am I not a captive in your hands? How could
I conceive such a design as you speak of when I
would be the first victim? You little know my
people, if you think they would attempt such a
thing against my will."</p>

<p>Pizarro was determined to get rid of him, so
he trumped up twelve charges against him, and,
after a mock trial, sentenced the helpless Inca to
be burned at the stake.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>When told of his fate, the poor king said to
Pizarro, with tears streaming down his face:</p>

<p>"What have I, or my children done, that I
should die like this? And from <i>your</i> hands&mdash;you
who have received only benefit and kindness from
me and my people."</p>

<p>The doom of the Inca was sounded by trumpet
in the same square he had innocently entered to
visit his strange white brother, and two hours after
sunset he was led out by torch-light and burned
to death.</p>

<p>To make sure that there was no danger of an
uprising in the distant parts of the country, Pizarro
sent an officer to finish collecting the ransom and
find out the actual condition. While he was gone
Pizarro had the Inca executed. When the officer
returned, he said:</p>

<p>"I have met with nothing but kindness on the
way. There has never been any attempt at an
uprising."</p>

<p>And this was the truth.</p>

<h2>The Gilded Man</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_188.jpg" width="119" height="123" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THERE were none willing to say
"God forgive him," is what
history tells us of the end of
Pizarro, whose throat was cut
by some of the men he quarreled
with over the treasures
they had taken from the Children
of the Sun, and I do not
believe that any one was ever sorry that he
perished like a wretched outcast. Of course, one
of his brothers had heard of El Dorado, and he
began to inquire closely of the Indians whether
there really was such a person.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is," he was told, "and this chief
smears himself all over with a sweet-smelling gum
and sprinkles his body with fine gold-dust until
he looks like a shining statue."</p>

<p>"Where does this chief live?"</p>

<p>"Not far from here, and his people are very
rich in gold and emeralds."</p>

<p>This was what the Spaniards wanted to hear,
and the Children of the Sun hoped by this means
to get rid of their hated conquerors. We
remember the visit of the Golden Hearted to the
Zipa of the Muscas, and we see, by the unfriendly
feeling of their neighbors, that they were still
quarrelsome.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>"We will go and find the Valley of the Gilded
Man," said the brother of Pizarro, to his soldiers,
who were getting tired of being idle. "I am told
that there are wealthy regions to the north, east, and
south of us, where the people go about covered with
gold-dust, and where there are no mountains or
woods."</p>

<p>This pleased the greedy adventurers very
much, and it was not long before there was quite
an army of them ready to start. But they did not
know that they were going into a country where
there were cannibals&mdash;savages ready to kill and eat
every one of them, and that they fought with poisoned
arrows. The Muscas were obliged to fight
these people, but they traded with them, because
there was no gold in their own land, and they
prized it highly as an offering in honor of the
Golden Hearted. They had quantities of salt which
they pressed into little round cakes, like sugar
loaves, and carried over beaten paths to market.
Besides this, they wove beautiful cotton cloth, and
managed to get large quantities of gold and silver
and emeralds by trading with the cannibals.</p>

<p>They had not forgotten what the Golden
Hearted taught them about hammering the gold,
or casting it into tasteful shapes, and they not only
wore it for ornaments, but used it to decorate the
outside and inside of their temples. It was near
the anniversary of his departure, and there were
many pilgrims from neighboring tribes who had
come to cast emeralds into the lake at Gautavita in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
his honor. On the mountain tops surrounding the
lake beacon lights were burning, and the sacred
fires on the altars in the temples had never been
allowed to go out. As each band of pilgrims came
into the city, the Zipa welcomed them, saying:</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, comrades, we will go in solemn
procession to the lake, and commemorate the departure
of Bochica, and his purification afterward.
We have made his heart very sad by our misdeeds,
but from his home in the sun he can look down
upon us, and see that we still adore and worship
him."</p>

<p>The next day, at noon a solemn procession
approached the lake. In the lead walked bronze-colored
men, without any clothing, but whose bodies
were covered with red paint, as a sign of deep
mourning, and they wailed in a most sorrowful
manner. Behind them were warriors decorated
with gold and emeralds, wearing bright feathers
in their gold head-dresses, and carrying mantles
of jaguar skins over their arms. Some of them
were singing, while others shouted joyfully or blew
on horns and pipes, and conch shells. Close to
them were priests in black robes, with white crosses
on them, and tall black hats, like those worn by
the wise men. In the rear was the Zipa riding in
a kind of gilded wheelbarrow hung with disks of
gold. His naked body had been anointed with a
resinous gum, and covered all over with fine gold-dust.</p>

<p>Arrived at the shore, the Gilded Man and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
companions stepped upon a balsa gay with streamers
and loaded with flowers, and rowed out into
the middle of the lake. There the Zipa, who was
the Gilded Man, plunged into the water and washed
off all the gold-dust. While he was doing this his
companions, with music and singing, threw in the
gold and emeralds they had brought out on the lake
for that purpose. Coming back to the shore the
Zipa said:</p>

<p>"Do no more work for this day, but make
merry with singing, dancing and feasting, as if
the gentle, kind Bochica were with you again."</p>

<p>All this time Pizarro's brother, and his greedy
soldiers, were wandering around in the mountains
trying to find the Gilded Man. If they could have
seen him covered with gold at the festival, they
would probably have tried to skin him alive to get
the gold dust on his body. One of the padres, who
came to convert and teach the natives, writing to
the king of Spain, said:</p>

<p>"I do not believe that the men taking part in
the expeditions in search of the Gilded Man, would
have tried so hard to get into Paradise."</p>

<p>Further on in his letter the padre describes
the terrible hardships and suffering the men had to
undergo. After telling about their failure to find
El Dorado, he says:</p>

<p>"The men and officers returned to us nearly
naked. In the warm rain their clothes had
rotted on their backs, and were torn into shreds by
the thickets they had crawled through on their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
hands and knees. Their feet were bare and
wounded by the thorns and roots in the pathways,
and their swords were not only without sheaths,
but were eaten up with rust. Hunger compelled
them to kill and eat their horses and dogs."</p>

<p>While this had been going on in Peru, the
King of Spain was busy sending out men for the
same purpose. The story of the Gilded Man was
known over all Europe, and other nations, besides
Spain, were trying to find him. Some German
bankers had loaned the king large sums of money
for the privilege of searching for El Dorado, and
the first white men to visit Gautavita was a band of
Germans sent out by the banking house. They
wanted slaves as well as gold, and were just as
merciless and cruel as the Spaniards. In fact, any
man having money enough to buy boats, or to provision
men, stole off into the woods and went in
search of the Gilded Man. The country was overrun
with armed bands of adventurers who were
ready to commit any kind of crime for the sake of
gain. Whoever offered resistance was killed, and
they were suspicious and jealous of each other,
as well as of the Indians.</p>

<p>After Pizarro's brother made such a miserable
failure, and had to endure such bitter hardships
one would expect his friends and associates to be
careful about making another venture, but they
knew of the German invaders, and then it was a
race to see who would get hold of the Gilded Man
first. Either side would have killed him and burned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
and pillaged the city, so the Indians had learned to
distrust and hate all white men, and they made
war on both the Spaniards and Germans whenever
they had an opportunity.</p>

<p>A young Spanish lieutenant, named Quesada,
was the real conqueror of the Muscas, and, as might
have been expected, he murdered the Zipa and
robbed Gautavita, and every other village in the
kingdom. He was as hard-hearted with his men,
as he was with the Indians, and after five hundred
of them had died from exposure on the way, they
found themselves surrounded on all sides by overflowing
rivers. Weeping and dejected they sought
Quesada, saying:</p>

<p>"We beseech you to send us back to Peru.
Instead of gold, only hunger, misery and death
await us here. The Gilded Man only exists in the
distorted fancy of those who believe the lying tales
of the Indians."</p>

<p>At this juncture they stumbled on to a path
with huts, at intervals, by the wayside, filled with
the white cakes of salt said to come from the home
of the Gilded Man, and they also found some cotton
cloth.</p>

<p>"We are on the right road at last," said
Quesada, to his dispirited soldiery. "Prove faithful
now, and we shall soon stand face to face with
El Dorado." With a significant nod of the head,
he added: "You know what that means to fearless
men, like yourselves, and you can trust to the generosity
of your captain for a rich reward."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>The prospect of getting plenty of gold soon
caused the men to forget all about their troubles,
but the Zipa not only fought them stubbornly, but
when he was finally compelled to abandon Gautavita,
there was no treasure to be found. The
Muscas had either buried all their gold and emeralds,
or thrown them into the lake. Great, indeed,
was the disappointment of the Spaniards, and for
his own safety Quesada soon planned another expedition
against a neighboring tribe of Indians. The
strange chief was surprised and captured in the
Council House, and with him perished all of the
notable men of the tribe. The soldiers found some
gold and some very fine emeralds, but when
they went to sack the Temple of the Sun, which
had a thatched roof, they carelessly set the dry
leaves on fire, and burned all the plate and other
treasures it contained. Bands of armed men rode
hither and yon looking for the Zipa, whom they now
believed to be the Gilded Man. He kept in very
close hiding, and no amount of torture, or promises
of reward could make his followers tell where he
was, or where the gold ornaments and vessels were
hidden.</p>

<p>"He is in the mountain fastnesses, where he
has a house made of gold," declared some irresponsible
Indians, glad to get rid of the cruel
Spaniards.</p>

<p>"Where is the house located?" Quesada asked,
eagerly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>"Some of the Indians say it is in the north,
some say the south, some say near by, and others
far away," answered his servant.</p>

<p>"Very well, we will search in all directions
until we find the miserable dog, and when we do
it shall go hard with him."</p>

<p>It took them several months to hunt him down,
and when they did find him he could not be induced
to tell anything about the treasures.</p>

<p>"I have a house of gold in the sun where my
master and lord, Bochica lives. I go to him, whom
I have faithfully served all my life."</p>

<p>After his death a new governor was sent from
Peru, and he undertook to drain the lake to get the
treasures of gold and emeralds which had been
thrown into it in honor of the Golden Hearted. The
Muscas were told that the new Governor would
be kind to them if they would tell where they had
hidden their wealth, but one of their priests said:</p>

<p>"Do you think a river will run up hill?"</p>

<p>The new Governor, hearing the remark, turned
to him, and said:</p>

<p>"No, it is not possible for water to run up
hill. Why do you ask such a foolish question?"</p>

<p>"How then, do you expect me to believe in the
existence of a white man who will be just to us?
One thing is quite as possible as the other."</p>

<p>And to this day no one knows what became of
the riches of the brave Muscas, but it is said that
they still remember the Golden Hearted, and in
secret, offer gold and emeralds in his honor.

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE death of the Zipa and the complete
subjugation of the Muscas, did not cause
people to forget the story of El Dorado.
On the contrary other nations soon
began to fit out expeditions to search for him, and
they went into some dreadful places in South
America thinking they would find him.</p>

<p>"What ails that dog of an Indian?" asked
Aguirre, the tyrant, and the worst of all the Spanish
adventurers looking for gold.</p>

<p>"He has fainted from fatigue," answered one
of his men.</p>

<p>"Then cut off his head. We have no time to
waste on these slaves."</p>

<p>"Let us unfasten the chain around his neck,
and then he can drop behind the rest of the gang,"
pleaded some of the Indians, who were being used
to help the horses carry the baggage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p>"It will take too long, and the whole chain-gang
of men would have to wait until we could
unfasten his neckband and put some one else in
his place. Chop off his head with this sword, and
go on."</p>

<p>The other officers tried to console the terrified
Indians by saying:</p>

<p>"If we were to leave him lying by the roadside,
some wild animal would come along and eat
him, so it is just as well for him as if we had done
as you wished."</p>

<p>Many people now say that Aguirre was insane,
and to this day the poor Christian Indians cross
themselves when they hear strange noises at night,
and exclaim:</p>

<p>"It is the soul of the tyrant Aguirre, who
plunged a dagger through the heart of his own
daughter when the King's officers came to arrest
and punish him for his cruelties. He is doomed
to wander over the swamps at night, and wail over
his terrible sins. His soul can never be at rest."</p>

<p>Like thistle-down scattered by the wind, were
the wonderful tales of El Dorado. No matter where
white men went they failed to find it, but the cunning
Indians always told them that it was still
farther away, because they wanted to get rid of
the unwelcome visitors, who tortured and enslaved,
as well as robbed them.</p>

<p>Finally Sir Walter Raleigh, who helped colonize
the state of Virginia, and named it for Good
Queen Bess of England, heard about the city of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Omagua, and the White Sea of the Manoas, and
he determined to find them, because there, he
believed, was El Dorado.</p>

<p>Some English sailors under his command
traded some pieces of old iron to the Indians for
shields of gold.</p>

<p>"Where did you get this metal?" was asked
of the Indians.</p>

<p>"In Omagua, where the tiles on the roofs of
the houses are made from the same glittering substance,
and where we hang crescents of it in front
of our doors to keep away evil spirits."</p>

<p>"What they say must be true," said the sailors
among themselves, "for they have gold crowns on
their heads, and breast-plates and earrings."</p>

<p>"Where is this city of Omagua?" again asked
the men.</p>

<p>"It is very far south, and is on a lake of gold.
Our chief lives in the House of the Sun, and has
many green stones in his shield and on the walls
of the temples."</p>

<p>"What is the name of your chief?"</p>

<p>"El Dorado," answered the Indians, anxious
that the white men should know that they could
speak their language.</p>

<p>"It is all plain to me," said Sir Walter
Raleigh, when told of it. "Those Spanish adventurers
have failed to find the real El Dorado. We
will search for it ourselves."</p>

<p>"The Indians say there are whole streets filled
with workers in gold and precious stones," said one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
of his officers, "and I dare say we shall make our
enterprise quite profitable." So they, too, were
looking for gold, only their methods were not so
barbarous and cruel as the others had been.</p>

<p>As they went farther into the country they
found a numerous band of Indians with flat heads,
and when they examined the babies carried on the
backs of their mothers it was seen that they had
tied a board across the forehead so that it would
sink in and leave the head pointed and flat in front.</p>

<p>"Why do you treat your heads in this manner?"
some one asked their chief.</p>

<p>"Because our fathers did so, and we think it
makes us beautiful," he answered. In that country
there are still plenty of flat-headed Indians. As the
men marched along they came to trees with holes
cut through the bark, and little earthen pots hanging
under them to catch the sticky-looking milk
that oozed out.</p>

<p>"Can this be something good to eat?" the men
said. "Let us taste it and see."</p>

<p>"Ugh! it has a nasty, disagreeable, bitter
flavor," said the speaker, licking his finger after
he had stuck it down into the pot. "It smells so
badly that it makes me feel sick," he continued,
spitting it out quickly.</p>

<p>"Here comes an old woman with some nuts
from the palm tree she has been shaking in her
hands. Let us ask her what this stuff is good for."</p>

<p>But the old woman evidently did not have a
very good opinion of white men, and would not
speak to them at all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>"We can watch her," they said, "and see
whether she intends to eat it."</p>

<p>She paid no attention to them, but went on
making a fire out of the palm nuts and some dry
leaves, and as soon as they blazed brightly she set
the little pot near the fire and began stirring the
milk with a wooden paddle she carried in her hand.
As soon as the blaze smouldered, she held the
paddle over it until the milk began to get thick.
Then she dipped it back into the pot and repeated
the process until there was enough coating to scrape
off and make a flat cake.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig201" id="fig201"></a>
<img src="images/i_200.jpg" width="339" height="242" alt="Drying India Rubber" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you please give me the biscuit?"
inquired one of the bystanders. Without a word the
old woman threw it at him, and when he caught it
in his hands, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It is India rubber! Now we can have a
game of ball!" As it was still warm he rounded
it into shape with his hands, and then he and his
companions amused themselves for quite a while
throwing the ball against the trees and catching it
as it bounded back. While they were engaged in
this sport the cooks were preparing them something
to eat, but the forest was full of monkeys swinging
themselves from one tree to another by their long
tails and seemingly very much interested in what
the men underneath them were doing.</p>

<p>Now, we all know that a monkey imitates everything
it sees, and so the whole band began to go
through the motion of throwing. As soon as they
found out there was something to eat they bobbed
their heads and screeched and chattered in great
excitement. Every time the cook's back was turned
they slid down a limb of the tree and grabbed a
dish and scampered back again. They had such
solemn little faces, and were so quick about it,
that the men shouted with laughter, but when they
sat down to eat, the monkeys jumped out of the
trees and rushed for the food.</p>

<p>The old Indian woman, comprehending the
situation, approached camp and said:</p>

<p>"Will the white chief let me cook something
for the monkeys?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you want to feed them?"</p>

<p>"A pot of rice," she answered, "such as I
know well how to prepare."</p>

<p>No one made any objection, and it was not
long before she had a big pan full of boiled rice,
which she had made almost red with pepper.
Taking a wide, green leaf, she laid it down and
poured the rice out to cool. No sooner had she
done so than the monkeys swarmed around the pile,
and squatting beside it began to eat by the handful.
Tears ran down their faces and water poured from
their mouths, but they kept on eating for a few
minutes. Then, suddenly seeming to suspect each
other of being to blame, they commenced fighting
with sticks and stones until they scattered the rice
all over the ground. By this time the pepper was
burning their mouths worse than ever, and not
knowing what was the matter they set up a doleful
howling, and ran pell-mell into the river quite a
distance from camp. They tumbled into the water
and rolled and wallowed in it, but it was some
little time before their mouths quit smarting, and
they were very willing to let the men alone.</p>

<p>The dogs belonging to the party gave chase,
but the monkeys screamed so that they awoke the
alligators sleeping in the sun on the river bank,
and then the dogs had to run for their lives. One
or two of them barely escaped being caught in the
wide open mouths of these monsters. It was very
much cooler when the sun went down, but that
brought out the mosquitos, and the men were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
obliged to sit in the smoke to save themselves from
being bitten dreadfully. They kept the fire going
all night, because they were afraid of the jaguars
and panthers hidden in the woods during the day,
but ready to kill and eat anything they might find
in their night prowls.</p>

<p>It was considered safer out of doors than in
the tents, but it was impossible to sleep on account
of the hideous noises made by the animals, monkeys,
birds and snakes.</p>

<p>"Why do these creatures keep up such a terrible
din?" asked the men of their Indian guides.</p>

<p>"Because they are keeping the feast of the
full moon," they replied, and this appeared to be
a settled belief among them.</p>

<p>"Men put the jaguar out of humor," they
explained. "He is a very selfish beast, and if he
cannot rule alone he goes to his den and sulks. He
will follow a man all day through the woods and
will not spring upon him unless he tries to run or
moves his arms. If you think one is following you
do not look back and do not trust anything but
the sharp blade of your sword. The noise of a
gun only infuriates him."</p>

<p>As the men heard this they imagined they could
see the yellow eyes glaring at them in the darkness,
and some thought they smelled him.</p>

<p>"He is a ferocious, blood-thirsty beast," said
the Indians in conclusion, "and you may well think
yourselves fortunate when you leave these tropic
forests and get out into the open plains."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>The men would have agreed with him if it had
not been for the intense heat, and a terrible sandstorm
that almost blinded them for days when it
did not blow so hard that they could make no
headway against it. Finally, footsore, weary, and
almost discouraged, they came to a wide and deep
river, and here the Indian guides brought them
boats, which they called pirogues.</p>

<p>"We are not far from the lake of gold beside
the city of the Manoas," they said, and when the
delighted soldiers inquired particularly, they
responded readily:</p>

<p>"We have these things from our fathers and
other men wise in the traditions and sayings of
our people, but we are afraid to go any further,
for the Manoans are a fierce and warlike race."</p>

<p>About this time Sir Walter Raleigh learned
that the Queen was not pleased with his efforts in
search of the El Dorado, and he decided to withdraw
his men and abandon the attempt.</p>

<p>But this did not hinder other men from trying
to solve the mystery. It was more than a hundred
years before the truth was finally known, and then
a scientist discovered that the location itself had
shifted and was nearly as much changed as the
ideas about El Dorado. He traced the legend to
Lake Parima, near the center of South America,
and said:</p>

<p>"This is really the White Sea of the Manoas,
which people have long believed was a lake of gold.
The reason the Indians thought so was because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
there is some fine gold-dust in the washings of the
sand, which has plenty of mica mixed with it.
Then there is a large quantity of salt dried on the
grass, and when the hot sun shines, it looks at a
distance as if it were a great sea of gold."</p>

<p>"Are the houses covered with gold tiles?" was
the next inquiry.</p>

<p>"No indeed: they are common huts with
thatched roofs on which the salt and mica glisten
and sparkle as they do in the grass and sand."</p>

<p>"Are the natives warlike? and do they eat
each other, as we have been told?"</p>

<p>"They are armed with javelins, wooden shields,
bows and arrows, and a short sword which they
make for themselves. We found them very friendly,
and as for their being cannibals that is all imagination,
but it may have been true in olden times."</p>

<p>And this is really what people spent millions
of money trying to find, and for which hundreds of
lives were uselessly sacrificed.</p>

<h2>The Mountain of Gold</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_206.jpg" style="margin-top: -3em" width="151" height="172" alt="V" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">VERY far to the north of Lake
Parima, is the celebrated Roraima,
the "Mountain of Gold," one of
the objects sought by the men who
were looking for El Dorado.</p>

<p>"Let us set out on an expedition
to see if we cannot solve the
mystery of this mountain, that is
not only rich in gold and precious
stones, but grows the Plant of Life in abundance,
which keeps one alive for hundreds of years,"
said some idle Cavaliers who had become reckless
in their eagerness to acquire sudden riches.</p>

<p>"But they say Roraima is inaccessible, so what
is the use of attempting the impossible?" said one
of the party, who had been out hunting.</p>

<p>"I believe that the flat top of the mountain is
inhabited, and that up there is the famous island
city of El Dorado," responded the first speaker.
"There is almost unlimited wealth to be had by
finding it, and these cowardly Indians are afraid to
go near it."</p>

<p>"It will be a long, tedious journey," said the
hunter, "and I doubt if we can persuade the slaves
to accompany us."</p>

<p>"They <i>shall</i> go," said the other, firmly, "and
if there is any sign of rebellion we have a remedy,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
he continued, pointing to his gun with a smile that
was not pleasant to see.</p>

<p>It was as the hunter feared. The Indian
porters and servants were nearly frantic at the idea
of being compelled to approach the dread mountain.</p>

<p>"The whole place is weird and uncanny," they
declared, "and the demon mountain is surrounded
by haunted woods, filled with camoodis and
didis."</p>

<p>When asked what a camoodi was, they
explained that it was a gigantic snake with a hood
over its head, and whose breath killed whatever it
touched, while the didis were man apes, ferocious
and terrible to see.</p>

<p>"It is a foolish superstition," said the Spaniards,
in derision, "and we will not listen to such
idle tales."</p>

<p>"Roraima is an island, connected underground
with the other mountains, and the lights you see
on the tops are put there by the demons to lure
us on to destruction."</p>

<p>"If it is inaccessible, how do these demons
manage to get up there?" asked the Spaniards.</p>

<p>"There are huge white eagles, that fly so high
we cannot see them; but they have very fine eyesight,
and many a poor brave has been seized by
them, and carried to the didis on the mountain."</p>

<p>"They must mean the big white birds we call
condors, found in the highest peaks of the Andes,"
said the Spaniards, "but our good weapons are
proof against any bird, and we need have no fear."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p>"As soon as it is dark in those terrible woods,
blood-sucking vampires swoop down from the trees
and fasten their long red bills in your throat,"
said the Indians, with a shudder, but no attention
was paid to anything they told of the hardships to
be endured.</p>

<p>"It is better for us to start at the beginning of
the dry season," said Carino, the Indian guide,
and in a short time the entire party was voyaging
on one of the splendid rivers that span that country.
In canoes they passed through untracked forests
and grassy savannahs following the course of the
river. Some places they were in great danger
from cataracts and rapids, but finally landed in a
place where there was a flock of red flamingos half
hidden by tall pampas grass, and where there were
hundreds of little wild ducks with tiny horns on
their wings. In the trees were some rare and
beautiful orchids, and when some of the party
climbed up to pick the big perfumed blossoms, they
were much surprised to find that what they thought
was a flower was a perfumed butterfly.</p>

<p>"We must be near the enchanted wood," said
the Spaniards, but just then they heard a sort of
combination of whistle, snort and hiss that
frightened them dreadfully:</p>

<p>"Carino! what is that?" they all said, huddling
up close together, and listening intently.</p>

<p>"It is the cry of the Lost Souls, who have
been slain by the camoodi," said Carino. "We
have already seen their strange shapes flitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
through the deep shadows. They are in league
with the didi to guard this spot." As he spoke the
Indian porters and slaves began a curious chant
in a singsong tone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>
Darkly from sunset to the rising sun,</p>
<p>A cry as of the pained heart of the wood,</p>
<p>The long despairing moan of solitude</p>
<p>And darkness and the absence of all good,</p>
<p>Startles the traveler with a sound so drear,</p>
<p>So full of hopeless agony and fear,</p>
<p>His heart stands still and listens with his ear,</p>
<p>The guide, as if he heard a death-bell toll,</p>
<p>Crosses himself and whispers "A Lost Soul."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The last words seemed to affect Carino deeply
and falling on his knees before the leader of the
expedition he said:</p>

<p>"My heart is heavy at the thought of your
undertaking to fight the demons of the mountain.
It is not good&mdash;this thing you are about to do.
The didis may tempt you to enter these fatal woods,
but they will trap you by closing the trail and you
will never be seen again."</p>

<p>"We will encamp here for the night, and tomorrow
at sunrise we will have a look at Roraima,"
said the leader, not feeling very comfortable over
the doleful noise called the wail of a lost soul.
"It may be that these Indians are not so far
wrong," he said to himself when their backs were
turned. "At any rate, I do not fancy going into
the woods so near nightfall."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p>After a long parley Carino succeeded in persuading
the porters and servants to venture a short
distance to get some wood for cooking and other
purposes. They had not been gone long when the
Spaniards heard a loud roaring bark, almost like
a trumpet, quickly followed by several more in
the immediate vicinity. Soon the Indians came
flying into camp terror-stricken.</p>

<p>"The Warracaba cats!" they shouted, and
before the Spaniards could stop them, they had all
piled into the canoes and were rowing for the
middle of the river. The white men stood with
guns raised as four screaming tigers sprang out
of the woods in full pursuit of the Indians they had
smelled, but not seen. Bang! bang! bang! went
the guns in rapid succession, and three of the four
tigers rolled on the ground dead or dying, while
the other one made off into the woods as fast as he
could go.</p>

<p>"That was a narrow escape, my masters,"
said Carino, shaking as if he had ague, "and the
other Warracaba will come back and bring companions.
These tigers hunt in packs like wolves,
and are not afraid of anything except deep water."</p>

<p>"What are we to do?" asked the leader,
gruffly, pale with fright. "Those dastardly slaves
have gone off and left us without a single boat.
Do you think you can call them back?" he asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I fear to answer that question," faltered
Carino. "I have warned you that my people fear
these woods, and are never willing to go into them."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<p>Then the Cavaliers began very foolishly to
blame each other for coming to such a place, and
were soon in high words&mdash;as if quarreling would
help them out of their difficulty.</p>

<p>"If you had not been so greedy for gold you
would never have undertaken such a journey,"
said one of them.</p>

<p>"And if you had been willing to work for an
honest living you would not have been so eager
to come with me," retorted the other angrily.</p>

<p>Carino realizing that something must be done
at once, interrupted the dispute by saying:</p>

<p>"There is an old Manoan witch named Monella,
who has lived at the edge of this wood for
hundreds of years, and if you will follow me I will
conduct you to her hut. The pathway is hung with
bell-shaped flowers of many hues, and these give
a dim light when the sun goes down. If we make
haste we may reach it before dark."</p>

<p>Without a word the Spaniards picked up what
things they needed for the night, and carrying them
on their backs in separate bundles, moodily followed
Carino. None but an Indian could have
found the way through such a tangled mass of
undergrowth. Suddenly Carino stopped and called
out:</p>

<p>"Beware! here is one of the fierce lords of the
wood, mouth open and bent upon attack." Being
an agile, quick fellow, he jumped to one side barely
in time to miss the venomous snake as it rushed
toward him. The warning made the Spaniards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
ready, and with unerring aim one of them shot
the reptile through the head.</p>

<p>"These are some of the guardians of Roraima,"
said Carino, solemnly. "They are not only
poisonous, but show fight, and will not run from
man."</p>

<p>By this time the Spaniards were beginning to
lose heart.</p>

<p>"If the Holy Mother preserves me through this
night I will give up this search for El Dorado,"
said the leader, and the other men agreed with him.</p>

<p>"The witch Monella has strange tales to tell
of Roraima. She has been through the secret
cavern in the side of the mountain, and up to the
top," said Carino.</p>

<p>"Does she say that there is gold up there?"
queried one of the Cavaliers. Before the guide
could answer, a large yellow puma stood in the
pathway, directly in front of them. A gun was
leveled to shoot at her, when Carino sprang forward
and said:</p>

<p>"Do not harm the puma. She belongs to Monella,
and no red man ever kills one of these animals.
They are always our friends, and to injure one is
to bring bad luck on yourself and family."</p>

<p>They went forward eagerly now for the thought
of a human habitation near by inspired them with
courage, and they were soon rewarded by seeing
a thin column of smoke issuing from an opening
in the dense foliage. Nearing the hut they were
met by a queer looking old Indian woman, who
had no teeth, and whose face was so wrinkled that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
she could scarcely see out of her eyes. Carino
approached her and said:</p>

<p>"We have come, good mother, to ask shelter
and food for the night. We are a band of travelers
who are left with no servants and must make our
way the best we can."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig214" id="fig214"></a>
<img src="images/i_213.jpg" width="341" height="302" alt="The Old Witch, Monella" />
</div>

<p>"Your strange white masters come on a useless
errand," said the old crone, blinking at them and
grinning in a knowing way. "You think to find the
hidden treasure of Roraima and to unearth its
buried secrets, but you will fail. No one living,
except myself, knows these things, and I will not
tell you more than is good for you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>"Do not quarrel with the old hag," said the
leader to Carino, "we need a place to sleep and
are very hungry, so give her some gold and tell
her we will do as she says."</p>

<p>"These are not Mellenda's men," said the
old crone to Carino, as she eyed them suspiciously.
"But the White Brotherhood would despise me if
I refused to shelter them from the dangers of the
forest at night. They are welcome to come and
sup with me."</p>

<p>When they had all been given something to eat,
and were sitting before the fire of pine knots, one
of the Cavaliers said:</p>

<p>"Tell us, good mother, how you have managed
to live so long. Carino says you are very old and
very wise."</p>

<p>"Since I was a little child I have drank a
tea made from the Plant of Life. Its juice is bitter-sweet,
and unless one has the Falloa, or Don't Care
Sickness, he can live always."</p>

<p>"Where did you get this wonderful plant?"</p>

<p>"It was given me by Ulama, the beautiful
daughter of Mellenda," answered the old woman,
proudly. "This is like her smiling face," she continued,
going back to a cupboard and getting a
curious old parchment roll from a shelf. As she
unwound the figure the astonished Spaniards saw
a fair representation of a yellow-haired girl with
a circlet of gold set with gems on her head. On
the breast of her flowing robe there was a golden
star, and around the waist there was a jeweled
girdle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>"Can you read this picture writing?" asked
one of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>"It is the language of my forefathers, and
as a child I could speak it well. Listen, and I will
tell you what it says. Long years ago there was
a rich and powerful white race living in these lands,
and they built a wonderful city on the Mountain
of Gold. But the Children of Darkness captured
the city, and they enticed people up there so
they could sacrifice them to the Devil-tree. There
is never any thunder or lightning on top of Roraima,
and its crest is a flat tableland edged with
a high forest and guarded by white eagles. The
mountains surrounding it were once islands in a
great lake, and Mellenda was the ancient king of
the Children of Light who lived there. The King
was a man of peace and very great wisdom, and he
had a wife and four beautiful children whom his
enemies, the Children of Darkness, sacrificed to
the Devil-tree while he was away in a distant part
of the kingdom. He had a great fleet and could
have punished the Children of Darkness."</p>

<p>The old crone ceased speaking, and seemed
lost in deep study. Finally Carino roused her by
asking:</p>

<p>"Did Mellenda do nothing for revenge?"</p>

<p>"No; he went away, but he promised he would
come back again, and he will. Not long after his
departure came the great sinking of the waters,
and the lake of Parima has disappeared into
another region of our country. For centuries after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
this the surrounding land was but a chaos of swamp
and mud. By degrees vegetation grew up, and in
time the trees became the thick tangled forest that
cannot now be penetrated."</p>

<p>"Did this Mellenda take with him all the gold
and silver?" asked a Cavalier, intent upon finding
something worth carrying away.</p>

<p>"In the city on top of the mountain is kept a
full suit of his gold armor, bright and ready, waiting
to receive him."</p>

<p>"We will get it and take it home with us,"
said the Spaniards, now all eagerness.</p>

<p>"We, of Mellenda's race, firmly believe that
he will come again, and none of us would dare
touch any of his belongings," said the crone,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"You need not touch it," began one of the
Cavaliers. "We will bring it down the trail ourselves."</p>

<p>"There is no trail up the sides of Roraima.
The entrance to its hidden passageway is guarded
by a giant Devil-tree."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see this Devil-tree?" asked her
visitors.</p>

<p>"Yes; a few years ago, I took my two pumas
and went to the cave for a certain purpose. As we
stood looking at the monstrous thing one of its
long, horny branches crept toward us, and one
of the pumas sprang forward to bite it. Instantly
it curled around the body of the poor creature,
dragging it until they came to the trunk of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
tree. Here shorter and thicker limbs knotted
together over the struggling puma, and finally all
rose in the air and almost disappeared in the
hollow trunk."</p>

<p>"Did you make no effort to rescue your pet?"</p>

<p>"I hacked the first branch with an axe until it
bled a dark, crimson liquid that smelled so badly
I was deathly sick. Every inch of the bark
is covered with small mouths that pierce the flesh
and suck the blood of its victims. I kept watch
until the moon came out, and then the knots of limbs
unrolled and out fell something. Each branch
tossed it before it reached the ground, when I saw
it was the crushed and lifeless puma. Out of a
slimy pool near by rushed huge alligators, and in
a few minutes they were eating what the Devil-tree
left of the puma."</p>

<p>"Let us go away from here," said the Spaniards
among themselves. "Instead of being an
earthly paradise, this is an infernal region."</p>

<p>When they were bidding the old crone good-bye
the next morning, she looked at them sharply
and said:</p>

<p>"You came here searching for gold, and
expected to find it ready for your use. My friends,
the great blessings of life must be worked for and
earned. You cannot cheat your way into Heaven,
nor will you or your people ever find any more
hidden treasures belonging to other races. You
will earn all the fortunes you get after this
adventure."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<h2>The Amazon Queens</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_218.jpg" style="margin-top: -5em" width="120" height="184" alt="W" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">WE should all get very tired I am
sure if we tried to follow the
Spaniards into every nook and
corner of the New World where they
went in search of El Dorado, but we are
interested in knowing that the name
Costa Rica means the rich coast, because
it was one of the El Dorado regions, and in
Panama, the little narrow strip of land which
unites North and South America, they expected
to find a Castle of Gold, while the Island of
Porto Rico is also one of the homes of El
Dorado. It made no difference to the Spaniards
whether the natives in these places had
heard of the Golden Hearted or not. They only
wanted to find the riches of the country, and would
not have listened to any teaching other than
that brought by the padres. So for years and
years they kept on making mistakes and undergoing
the most terrible hardships trying to acquire
sudden wealth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<p>One of the stories that is very queer was that
about the Amazon Queens. Columbus wrote of
them, and this is what he said:</p>

<p>"On the first island discovered on the voyage
from Spain to the Indies, no men are allowed to
live. The female warriors do not follow any
womanly occupations, but use bows and arrows of
cane, and cover as well as arm themselves with
brazen plates, of which they have many."</p>

<p>He says nothing of their having great wealth,
but Cortez also heard of them, and wrote to the
King of Spain that the island was ten days distance
from a province in Mexico, and that many
persons had gone there and seen the women warriors.
He concludes his letter by saying:</p>

<p>"I am told that these fighting women are rich
in pearls and gold."</p>

<p>This news was quite enough to start the Spaniards
on a search for the island, and, as usual, the
Indians gave them much contradictory information
about its location. Some said it was north
and some said it was south, so exploring parties
were sent in both directions. A man by the name
of Guzman came up into Mexico as far north as
Sinaloa, looking for this wonderful island, and his
march was one of devastation and murder. He not
only compelled the Indians to accompany him as
slaves to do all the drudgery, but tortured such
chiefs as he thought had gold, and in many cases
killed them because they either did not give it to
him quickly enough, or in as large quantities as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
he wanted. The farther north he went the poorer
the natives were.</p>

<p>"Instead of a rich island inhabited by soldierly
women," he exclaimed, in disgust, "I find a few
insignificant villages occupied by women and
children, because the men have all fled to the mountains.
In the whole country there is not a trace of
gold, pearls or treasures of any kind."</p>

<p>Along the way he found very scant supplies
of gold, and this made him furious, for he returned
to the city of Mexico poorer than when he left it.</p>

<p>Pizarro and his followers in Peru heard of the
Amazon Queens, and so did Sir Walter Raleigh
and the German adventurers, but their country
was said to be along the banks of a very wide river
in South America. The Indians called them the
Great Ladies, and the river has since been named
the Amazon in their honor.</p>

<p>"If the Great Ladies do not invite you to visit
them, it is a very dangerous thing to attempt,"
said the Indian guides to Orellana, the man who
discovered the Amazon river, and was the first to
sail its entire length.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" asked Orellana.</p>

<p>"Because they are tall, strong-limbed and fair,
and are great fighters. They wind their long hair
across their foreheads in thick bands, and defend
themselves well."</p>

<p>"What kind of weapons do they use?" queried
the Spanish soldiers, when they could stop laughing
at the Indians for being afraid of a lot of
women.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>

<p>"They shoot with blow-pipes, bows and
arrows, and have a war-club that they wield with
great vigor," answered the Indians, with serious
faces.</p>

<p>"Are they always so hostile to men?"</p>

<p>"Only the grandfathers of this generation
have seen them, and none save the Kings of the
Borderers ever venture near their habitation."</p>

<p>"How are the Kings of the Borderers received
by these strange women?"</p>

<p>"They meet them at the frontier of their
possessions with bows and arrows in their hands,
but after an exchange of pledges the Great Ladies
invite the men to come and feast and dance with
them. Sometimes they stay a month, and then the
Queens escort them to the edge of their land, and
send them home loaded with presents."</p>

<p>"What kind of presents do they give?" asked
the Spaniards, suddenly taking a great interest in
what was being said.</p>

<p>"There are gold ornaments in plenty, and
emeralds and pearls, besides the grains of gold
carried in eagle quills."</p>

<p>"We will capture these Great Ladies," interrupted
the Spaniards, excitedly. "We will teach
them their proper places when we get hold of them.
Why do you Indians allow them to live in such a
manner?"</p>

<p>"Our forefathers have taught us to hold them
in great veneration, because they live in a Mansion
of the Sun. Long years ago they were Virgins of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
the Sun, but in the wars between the different
tribes they were allowed to separate from the rest
and live in a community by themselves."</p>

<p>"Do they build houses?"</p>

<p>"They have temples, and keep the sacred fires
burning on the altars, as was done in olden times."</p>

<p>"Who rules them, and what do they do with
their boy babies?"</p>

<p>"They select their own queen, and the boy babies
are given to the Kings of the Borderers; they
only keep girl babies in their tribe, and when they
grow up they become either warriors or priestesses."</p>

<p>"How do they support themselves?"</p>

<p>"By hunting, fishing, weaving cloth and
trading with their neighbors."</p>

<p>"Where do they get their riches?"</p>

<p>"From the mountains of Parima, where they
have secret storehouses filled with treasures they
have been hoarding for ages."</p>

<p>This pleased the Spaniards very much, and
quite decided them to make a raid upon that
country. Even after they had talked the matter
over fully among themselves they recalled the
Indians and questioned them still further.</p>

<p>"Would you be afraid to undertake to fight
these strange women?" they asked, when they saw
that the guides were unwilling to accompany them.</p>

<p>"No, we are not afraid, but we are enjoined
to let them alone. None of us would ever think of
disturbing them. They are very fierce, and will
kill any man that they do not like."

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>"But you could easily conquer women warriors,"
urged the Spaniards, now eager to commence
the journey.</p>

<p>"It would not be so easily done as you imagine,"
said the guides, shaking their heads doubtfully.
"The Great Ladies wear thick shields and
cover their clothes with metal discs which turn
away an arrow point."</p>

<p>"We can easily overcome that protection with
our guns, and we are not commanded to respect
them," replied the Spaniards.</p>

<p>"You will find that they have deep underground
retreats to which they fly in times of
danger, and they are known to be excellent shots."</p>

<p>Just then a party of prospectors returned
from the mountains where they had been looking
for gold. Among the things they brought was a
number of thin, flat green stones with holes pierced
in each end, showing that they had been used for
ornaments. The Indian guides said at once they
were the same kind of emerald as that worn by the
Amazon Queens for an amulet against disease.</p>

<p>"How did you succeed in getting them?" they
asked.</p>

<p>"From some Indian pedlars we met with
packs on their backs. They said the stones would
cure the spleen, and we have been wearing them
ever since."</p>

<p>"Did you have any difficulty in persuading
the pedlars to part with them?"</p>

<p>"No; they said they got them from a tribe of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
women warriors many leagues to the south, but we
did not believe them."</p>

<p>"It is all true," said the guides, "and these
Great Ladies have been in that land a very long
time."</p>

<p>"If we can find enough of these spleen stones
to make our trip profitable we do not care whether
we meet the Great Ladies or not," said the prospectors,
when told of the proposed trip in search
of the Amazon Queens.</p>

<p>As the party pushed forward into the tangled
thickets, they found cocoanuts, and plantains, ripe
and ready to eat, and they also found some very
juicy little canteloupes growing on a vine, but
none of the Indians living on, or near the Amazon
river, could tell them where to find the Queens.
They searched up and down the banks for a hidden
passageway which was said to guard the entrance
to their mountain home, but to all questions the
river made no answer. To the disappointed Spaniards
it looked angry, sullen and relentless in the
untamed might of its turbid waters.</p>

<p>"It seems to be always summer here," said
the weary soldiers, "but one would die of malarial
poisoning if compelled to stay long."</p>

<p>Some of the guides felt sorry for the sick men,
and went into the woods and brought them sarsaparilla
bark, and made them a tea of it.</p>

<p>"Drink this," they said, "because it will cure
your sickness which comes from the head. If
your heart was strong with love for your brothers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
you would find blessings in this land. As it is
you seek to plunder and rob the Great Ladies, but
the Sun is their father, and he will make the
mountains, trees and rocks hide them and their
treasures."</p>

<p>"It is no use to look for these women any
longer. We shall all die before we can reach
them," said the leader, wearily.</p>

<p>And no one to this day knows just where the
Amazon Queens lived.</p>

<h2>The Seven Cities of Cibola</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_227.jpg" style="margin-top: -4em;" width="144" height="135" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE Nahuas in Mexico were really a
sect of wise men descended from
those that came with the Golden
Hearted. They believed that they originated in
Seven Caves, which were not locations at all,
but was only a way of saying that human
beings have seven wonderful qualities. They
might have thought so because we can see,
feel, taste, hear and smell, and have instinct
and are able to reason, or it may have been
something else. At any rate, it did not mean actual
caves, but was a symbol. In later times when
people were not so wise, they said it was seven
tribes instead of caves, and when the Spaniards
heard about it they managed to twist it into seven
cities, and immediately conceived the idea that
great riches and gold could be found in them.
When questioned on the subject the Indians said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p>"To the far north there are seven wonderful
cities where the people make arrow-heads of emeralds
and take the sweat off their bodies with
scrapers of pure gold, and have jeweled gates, and
turquoise ornaments over their doors."</p>

<p>"Do these men know how to work precious
stones and metals?" asked the Spaniards eagerly.</p>

<p>"There are long streets filled with jewelers
who make rings for the ears, nose and arms," they
said. "Forty days must you journey to reach this
land, and you must travel through a desert where
there is neither water nor food to be had."</p>

<p>The first Spaniard to attempt the search for
the Seven Cities was the cruel Guzman, who looked
north for the Amazons. He had with him quite an
army, and his men were so excited over the stories
they heard that they scarcely took time to eat or
sleep on the way. They hoped every day to find
the cities, but instead of this the country grew more
desolate, the road more difficult, and the cities still
farther to the north. Then the Spaniards began
to complain, and said:</p>

<p>"We have been deceived, and shall all die in
this bleak land. Let us return to Mexico." And
they did. For six years no one had the courage to
seek the Seven Cities.</p>

<p>Then something very strange happened.</p>

<p>Into a little seaport where Cortez had ordered
some ships built to explore the western coast, came
wandering four strange men. They were barefooted,
and had no clothing except some old, dirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
skins with the hair worn off in spots. Their heads
were a perfect mass of tangles, and their beards
reached almost to the knees. Falling flat on their
faces before the first white man they saw, they cried
out in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Thank God! We are safe at last!" When
the astonished Spaniard turned to look at them,
they seized his hands and kissed them, and springing
to their feet danced and shouted for joy.</p>

<p>"These are escaped maniacs," said the people,
gathering around to look at them. "Whatever
shall we do with mad men?"</p>

<p>"No, no! You do not understand. We are
poor wanderers who have been lost for years among
the Indians."</p>

<p>"Let us take them to our Captain. There is
something very strange about this," said the
Spaniards, and they started at once.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the Captain, rudely,
looking with disgust at their dirt and rags.</p>

<p>"I am a noble of Castile who came to help
conquer Florida, and my name is De Vaca," said
the oldest man. "The fleet was wrecked and all
were lost except my companions here, and me.
All the years since we have been with the Indians."</p>

<p>"I do not believe a word of it," said the
Captain. "Put these fellows in prison until we
find out about them. They may be criminals."</p>

<p>For three months they lay in prison, and then
the Alcalde came and released them.</p>

<p>"Tell me your story," he said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>"When the ships were lost," responded De
Vaca, "we swam to the mainland, and were captured
by the Indians. They were a poor, starved
tribe who lived on roots and berries, and often
went days without a mouthful. We had with us
a rattle, and this, with our beards, made them
think we came from Heaven, and were great medicine
men. They fell on their faces before us and
gave us all they had. We asked them to take
us where the sun sets, but they refused, and we
pretended to be very angry, until they finally let
us go. After months of wandering we came to
a land of plenty, where the people were wealthy,
and wore beautiful plumes in their head-dresses.
They brought us five emeralds cut into arrow-heads,
and many fine turquoises, and beads made
of coral. When I asked where they got these
stones, they pointed to some lofty mountains
toward the north and told us the gems came from
there, and that near them were large cities, with
houses three or four stories high. I did not go
there because I heard that toward the sunset were
other men of my kind, and I longed once more to
look upon the face of a Spaniard."</p>

<p>"Of course," said the people, as they talked
the matter over, "these are the same cities Guzman
tried to find. He did not go in the right direction,
but we know where they are," and many were
eager to set out at once. But the Viceroy was a
quiet and careful man.</p>

<p>"There have been many lives lost already,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
he said, "and it will be best not to hurry. I shall
not send an army there until I am sure."</p>

<p>Then he thought of a padre, named Fray
Marcos, who had lived much among the Indians of
the north, and he sent for him, and said:</p>

<p>"Perhaps there lies to the north as rich a
nation as Mexico or Peru. If so it must be conquered
for the Church and the King of Spain.
You know how to speak to the Indians, and it
might be that they would let you come among them
and learn the truth. Will you undertake to do so?"</p>

<p>"God giving me strength I will," said Fray
Marcos, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Very well. The negro Stephen, who was
with De Vaca is here, and is willing to be your
guide. If you come to any great city do not send
back word, but return yourself and tell me about
it. Make all your plans and set out as soon as
possible."</p>

<p>Fray Marcos did as he was told, but it was
several months before anything was heard of him.
One day a traveler, in a monk's gown, came walking
into the same seaport that De Vaca had visited.</p>

<p>"It is Fray Marcos, who went in search of
the Seven Cities! Did you find them! Are they
full of wealth? Where is the negro Stephen?"</p>

<p>Fray Marcos would not answer their questions.</p>

<p>"I have much to tell, but my news is for the
Viceroy himself," said the padre, and he started
for the city of Mexico. When there he said to the
Viceroy:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p>"The Indians came out to meet and welcome
me everywhere. They had food ready for me,
and where there were no houses, they built bowers
of trees and flowers that I might rest safe from the
sun. I spent four days journeying through a
desert, and then I found some Indians who marveled
much to see me. They thought, because I
was white and wore a gown, that I must have come
from Heaven. I asked them if they knew of any
great kingdom where there were seven large cities,
and they told me that farther on were high mountains
with wide plains at the foot where the people
lived in cities and clothed themselves in cotton.
I sent Stephen ahead three-score leagues, and
charged him to send back Indians to bring me
news of his success. If the country was poor and
mean, he was to send me a cross no longer than my
hand; if it were a goodly place the cross was to
be two lengths of a hand, and if he found what he
sought he was to send me a large cross. In four
days a messenger came from Stephen bearing a
cross as high as a man. He brought news of a
mighty province called Cibola, thirty days journey
northward from the town where Stephen was. In
this province there are seven great cities governed
by one Prince."</p>

<p>"You should have followed at once to make
sure that all these things were true," said the
Viceroy, now very much interested.</p>

<p>"I did," responded Fray Marcos. "Each day
messengers came to me carrying large crosses and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
giving more particulars concerning Cibola.
Finally I entered a valley where there were many
people, and all of them had turquoises hanging
from their noses, and ears, and collars of the same
three or four times double around their necks.
Then I had to go through another desert, and was
beginning to get very tired when one day there
came running to me, an Indian in great fright&mdash;his
body covered with sweat and dust, and his face
showing extreme sadness. He said that the day
before Stephen had reached Cibola, and had sent
guides into the city with presents for the chief,
and to let them know he came in peace. But the
great Lord of the City flew into a rage and dashed
the presents to the ground. He drove the messengers
out in fury, and said he would kill them
if they came back again. He said, too, that he
would kill Stephen. But the negro was not afraid,
and went directly into the city. Instantly they
were seized and cast into a prison, where they were
kept all night without anything to eat or drink.
The next morning Stephen and his guides tried to
escape, but the people killed all of them except one
other and the messenger who came to me. These
two were struck down and left for dead, but were
only stunned, and when the angry people went
away they crept out in the night, and made their
escape."</p>

<p>"What did you do then, Fray Marcos?" asked
the Viceroy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig235" id="fig235"></a>
<img src="images/i_234.jpg" width="490" height="345" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"ONE OF THE SEVEN CITIES OF CIBOLA"</p>
</div>

<p>"So great was my grief that it seemed for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
moment as if I should die, but when my guides
began to weep and lament I gave them the presents
I intended for the Lord of Cibola, and resolved
to go and see the city, even if I could not enter
it. I traveled one day and came to a round hill,
which I climbed. Looking down I saw the beautiful
city of Cibola."</p>

<p>"And the houses, were they as the Indians told
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord; they were built of stone four
stories high, and glistened in the bright sunshine.
The people were fair and dressed in white. Greatly
was I tempted to risk my life and go down to them,
but I contented myself with planting a cross and
hurrying here to tell you what I had done."</p>

<p>"That was right, Fray Marcos," said the
Viceroy, "and now it is time to send an army."</p>

<p>The first person the Viceroy thought of to
lead the soldiers was a brave nobleman, named
Coronado, who sat by his side. He had been listening
eagerly to all that Fray Marcos had to tell.
Turning to him the Viceroy said:</p>

<p>"It is my wish that you should command my
forces and conquer this Kingdom of Cibola. I
desire you to make ready at once."</p>

<p>"Fray Marcos simply confirms what Guzman
and De Vaca have already told us," replied Coronado,
"and I accept your commission with one
proviso."</p>

<p>"And what may that be?" asked the Viceroy,
with a smile.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>"That you allow me to bear the expenses of the
entire expedition."</p>

<p>"Very well, and when you find Cibola I will
make you its governor and give you all the
treasures you find except what justly belongs to
the King of Spain, and his representatives and
soldiers taking part in the enterprise."</p>

<p>So great was the excitement over Fray Marcos'
story of the new El Dorado, that Coronado scarcely
knew what to do with the volunteers of all classes
who came flocking into camp determined to go
with him. He not only spent all his own money,
but borrowed all he could get and provided for
every one in splendid style. They marched out in
glittering armor, on prancing horses with lances
gleaming in the sunshine and banners flying gayly.
They were all in high spirits because they expected
to return in a short time loaded with gold and
jewels.</p>

<p>But it was very different when they reached
the desert and mountains, for they did not know
how to bear the fatigue of such a journey, nor how
to care for their horses, cattle and sheep. The
animals died rapidly, and the soldiers got into
many fights with the Indians who resented being
robbed and badly treated. On they went through
what we now call Arizona, over almost the same
road that Fray Marcos had traveled, and found,
instead of the fine, glittering city they expected,
only a few houses of one of the Zuni Indian
villages.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<p>The hearts of the Spaniards sunk as they gazed
upon it. Calling some of the men, Coronado said:</p>

<p>"Go in to the people of the city, and say
that we come to defend and join with them in
friendship."</p>

<p>They went and delivered Coronado's greeting,
but were received with scorn.</p>

<p>"We did not ask you to come, and your chief
had no right to send you. This is our land, and we
can defend it. If you attempt to stay here we will
kill every one of you." Even as the soldiers,
carrying the message, turned to go away the people
of Cibola began firing arrows at them. Coronado
quickly gave the command to attack, which the
Indians answered by a shower of arrows and stones
which they sent down from their high-walled
houses. They seemed bent upon killing Coronado;
twice they felled him to the ground, but he recovered
and led the charge with an arrow sticking
through his foot.</p>

<p>"Santiago! and at them!" he shouted, as he
rode forward in the last assault.</p>

<p>"Santiago," echoed his soldiers, close at his
heels. When the Indians saw the horses coming
at full speed into their village, they threw down
their bows and arrows, and fled in every direction.</p>

<p>Then the Spaniards almost cried with anger
and disappointment. The houses were really made
of stone, but there were no jewels, no gold, no
treasures of any kind&mdash;nothing, in fact, but a poor,
miserable Indian pueblo, or village, built upon a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
high ledge of rocks, miles away from the fields of
corn, beans and squashes, upon which they lived.
All the Indians in that part of the United States
built their houses in pueblos, or villages, but not
one of them had any treasures. They irrigated the
dry, sandy soil and tilled their fields, and were a
simple, kindly people, until the greedy Spanish
soldiers drove them into rebellion which has left
their country bare and desolate, even to this day.</p>

<h2>The Kingdom of Quivera</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_239.jpg" style="margin-top: -5.5em;" width="147" height="163" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE air was full of the chill and
blast of winter, and with the first
snow-flakes great discontent broke
out in camp, and Coronado realized
that he must find a place to
make his men more comfortable.</p>

<p>"There are ten big community houses on top
of that spider-shaped rock," he said, one morning
to a squad of soldiers who had been drilling on
parade ground, "and I want possession of it for
the troops. Some one must go ahead first and
report the situation."</p>

<p>"The rock is so high that our bullets scarcely
reach to the top," said the scout, who had galloped
over to the pueblo to spy out a way of doing what
Coronado commanded. "But there are four winding
paths leading up the sides, and we can ascend
in single file."</p>

<p>"Have you tried it?" asked Coronado.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and found it quite an easy task. I spent
last night there, and as the rays of the sun took
leave of the lofty Sierras, I felt forsaken, and as
if I were about to float away into the darkness."</p>

<p>"Did the Indians suspect your purpose in
coming?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, and all my gloomy feelings
passed away as soon as the fires began to blaze on
the roofs at different heights of the same building.
Inside the houses laughing voices greeted me, and
I was glad to be the guest of such simple people."</p>

<p>"Do you think we would be safe from attacks
and surprises at night?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. And when once up there it would
be almost impossible to come down at night. The
narrow paths are really unsafe except in daylight."</p>

<p>It was not long until the Spaniards had forcible
possession of the village, and during the long,
dreary winter months they went about in rusty helmets,
battered cuirasses, ragged doublets and worn-out
boots, while the Indians wrapped themselves
in thick coverings made of rabbit skins. Every
morning the bell called them to mass, and then the
criers went up and down announcing the day's duty
to every one in the camp. On the plains below was
heard the neighing of horses, the lowing of cattle
and the bleating of sheep.</p>

<p>In the pueblos near by the Indians danced,
and gathered around the fires to listen to the old
men's stories of their past, and as the winter drew
to a close the Spaniards were no longer homesick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
and despondent, but ready and willing to test the
truth of some of the things the Indians had told
them of the Wrathy Chieftain and the Kingdom of
Quivera.</p>

<p>At Pecos the scouts were received with music
and presents of cotton cloth and handfuls of turquoises,
because the inhabitants were not sure but
that the white men came from the sun, and were
sent by the Golden Hearted, whom they revered
and honored as the Wrathy Chieftain.</p>

<p>In this village they met a strange-looking
Indian.</p>

<p>We will name this fellow the "Turk," because
he looks so like one, and find out, if we can, where
he lives. "May be his people have gold," said
the soldiers, as soon as they arrived at Pecos.</p>

<p>"My home is very far to the east," said the
Turk, when questioned, "and we have plenty of
gold."</p>

<p>"What is the name of your country!"</p>

<p>"Quivera, and my king's name is Tatarax.
He wears a long beard, and worships a golden cross
and an image of the Queen of Heaven."</p>

<p>Had the Spaniards been at all cautious and
shrewd they would have taken pains to find out
how true this statement was, but they were so
tired of being in camp, that they were glad of an
opportunity to go on another expedition in search
of an El Dorado, which they always hoped to
find.</p>

<p>"The chiefs of the Pecos have taken a gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
arm band of mine," said the Turk, wishing to make
trouble between them and the Spaniards. "No
matter what I say to them, they will not give it
back to me."</p>

<p>He described the band as being so wide and
heavy that Coronado was induced to seize the
chiefs and carry them off to another pueblo in the
hope of compelling the Pecos Indians to pay a
big ransom for them. In addition the Spaniards
demanded cotton clothes and provisions for their
journey. The Indians refused, and fought two
weeks before Coronado became satisfied that the
Turk never had such a thing as an arm band, and
that there was no gold in the village.</p>

<p>"It is no use to waste time looking for
treasures in this part of the world," he finally told
his men, and they immediately began to question
the Turk.</p>

<p>"I know a country," he declared, "where
there is a very wide river that has fish in it as big
as a horse. The people tip their canoes with gold,
and sometimes there are forty rowers in a boat.
Every vessel they use is made of gold and silver."</p>

<p>All the time he was talking he watched the
faces of the soldiers with keen craftiness, and when
he saw how delighted they were, he made the story
just as big as he could.</p>

<p>"There are plenty of such places," he said,
with a toss of his head, "but my country of Quivera
is the most important of them all, and I will take
you there first."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>When any one gets lost on the plains where
there are no hills or trees to mark the way, they
wander around in a circle, and finally get into a
perfect frenzy by coming back to the same place
over and over again.</p>

<p>This was what happened to the Spaniards
under Coronado. They returned in a wide bend
to Pecos, after marching for months on the desolate
plains.</p>

<p>"Led around in a circle," he said, "as if by
some evil spirit. Everywhere we went we found
ourselves surrounded by herds of misshapen,
crinkly-wooled cows. Some of them had calves,
and the bulls had beards of sunburnt hair. Our
horses took fright and ran away, while some of
them plunged and threw their riders over their
heads."</p>

<p>"Were these woolly cows ferocious?" asked
the good padre, who had remained at Pecos to
teach the Indians, and had never seen a buffalo.</p>

<p>"They are very terrible when they stampede.
If they catch sight of a white man, they lower their
heads and with a quick, short bellow set off at full
tilt in a heavy, rolling gallop. On they come, like
a mad rush of waters, tails high in the air and
their big eyes gleaming with fright. We had much
ado to keep out of their way, for they would run
over and trample all to death."</p>

<p>"No wonder your horses ran away," said
the padre. "It was quite enough to frighten
anything."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>"Finally we met some of the people who go
around the country with the cows. They make
tents of the hides and wear them for blankets, and
keep huge dogs to carry their food and baggage.
They were friendly to us, but knew nothing of
Quivera and its treasures."</p>

<p>But the feeling of helplessness and desolation
of the plains gradually left the Spaniards, and then
they were ready to follow the Turk's lead again.
This time they got lost in the desert, and many of
them wandered off and died from thirst, and their
bodies were eaten by wolves and coyotes. They
kept going round and round in a circle until their
tongues hung out of their mouths and they were
delirious. In the hot, quivering air they imagined
they saw cities, and lakes and springs of water,
and they laughed and cried, and sung and danced
in a raging fever. At last they began to suspect
the Turk.</p>

<p>"He is purposely leading us astray," they
said. "He is trying to lose us on these desolate
plains where we will starve to death. He intends
to desert and leave us here."</p>

<p>They put the Turk in chains, and then he confessed
that he had never seen the big stone houses
he said were in Quivera, but stoutly insisted that
the country was rich in gold and silver.</p>

<p>The Prairie Indians begged Coronado to turn
back.</p>

<p>"The land of Quivera is forty days' journey
toward the north," they said, "and you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
suffer from hunger long before you reach other
tribes."</p>

<p>But Coronado had spent all his money and was
in debt deeply, so he determined to take twenty-nine
picked horsemen and go forward. Leaving the
rest of the company to find their way back to Pecos,
he engaged some new guides among the Prairie
Indians and pushed on determined to find Quivera.
They rode directly north until they came to a place
in Kansas near where the city of Leavenworth is
now located.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Pecos Indians went on
the warpath and refused to receive or aid the
Spaniards who left Coronado and went back to
them. He found them encamped before the pueblo
when he returned months after, weary, empty-handed,
and disappointed.</p>

<p>"I have found Quivera and explored it well,"
he said, "but it has no permanent settlement, and
no gold and silver. I was expecting to see houses
several stories high, made of stone. Instead of that
they are simple huts and the inhabitants are perfectly
savage."</p>

<p>The Turk tried to secure his freedom by saying
that the Pecos Indians had hired him to lose the
Spaniards on the plains, but no one paid any attention
to him. In revenge he said to the people of
Quivera:</p>

<p>"Do not let one of these white men escape
alive. They will bring others of their kind and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
rob you of all your possessions and ill treat your
women and children. They have already killed
many of the Pecos."</p>

<p>Some one told Coronado what was being said,
and he ordered his soldiers to take the Turk out
and hang him to the first tree they found, which
they did.</p>

<p>Coronado spoke the truth about Quivera, but
even the men who went with him believed that
there was a land near by where they would find
great riches, and they kept repeating all the stories
about El Dorado until Coronado was obliged to
promise them that he would make another effort
to find it.</p>

<p>"If we go north again we can be certain of
good food for the soil is the best that can be found
for all kinds of crops. In Quivera we were given
plums, nuts, very fine grapes, mulberries and flax.
I really believe we shall make some important discoveries
very soon."</p>

<p>One day at Pecos after he had made friends
with the Indians, he was tilting with an officer in
his command when his saddle girth broke while
his horse was running at full speed. He fell on his
head and was run over and so badly hurt that for
days it was thought he would die. Before he got
well news came from Mexico that the Indians
behind him were on the warpath, and then he knew
he must retreat as quickly as possible. So instead
of going in quest of the roving band of Quivera
Indians, he was obliged to return to the city of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Mexico. Here the Viceroy received him coldly and
upbraided him, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"It is a source of keen disappointment and
regret to me, that you, my trusted friend and
favorite officer, should abandon the rich treasures
of the north. I wish you to go to your estate and
live in retirement for the remaining years of your
life. I will try to find some one more worthy of
my confidence for future work."
</p></div>

<p>Reduced to poverty, with many debts unpaid,
and disgraced by the Viceroy, the poor unfortunate
nobleman lived only a few years on his estate in
Mexico and died heartbroken over his failures.</p>

<p>Everybody in Mexico believed that he was mistaken,
and several other expeditions set out to find
the Kingdom of Quivera. More than a century
afterward the legend settled around one of the
missions founded by the padres, and for years
people thought this was the Grand Quivera. Great
treasures were supposed to be buried there by the
missionaries when the insurrection of 1680 came.
That year all the Indians in the region of Arizona
and New Mexico organized a general uprising and
they not only killed all the whites they could find
but sacked and burned the missions. And that
is the last ever heard of the one known as the
Grand Quivera. No treasures were ever found in
or near its ruins. There are ten curious maps of
that time and each one locates the kingdom of
Quivera in a different place. One of them brings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
it as far north as the Sacramento Valley in
California.</p>

<p>Really Quivera is a will-o'-the-wisp, and from
a roving band of Indians, has become a wandering
treasure city, and a land of vague and mysterious
proportions.</p>

<h2>The Land of Gold</h2>

<div>
<img  class="drop-cap" src="images/i_249.jpg" style="margin-top:-4em;" width="146" height="205" alt="I" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IF any of the boys and girls born
in the United States were asked
"Where is the land of gold?"
they would answer "It is California,"
and if any of the children
born in California were asked
"What is El Dorado?" they would
say "Why, that means the land of
gold."</p>

<p>So it does and for two reasons.</p>

<p>Cortez named it California after the heroine of
a romance of chivalry he had read when he was in
Spain. The book said there was an island on the
right hand of the Indies very near the terrestrial
Paradise, peopled with black women, who were
Amazons, and wore gold ornaments in great profusion.
Down in his heart Cortez cherished the
hope that he might find the northwest passage to
India, not because he cared very much for science,
but because he believed the most extravagant stories
about the silks, spices, sweet-smelling gums and
rare gems to be found there. His ill-gotten Mexican
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
gold did him very little good, and was soon all
expended, and he was anxious to find some other
country to conquer. The very next year after the
death of Montezuma, Cortez heard of the Land of
Gold, and came over to a cove on the Pacific Coast
of Mexico where he laid out a town and built some
ships for the purpose of finding the new wonderland.
All he ever discovered was the peninsula of
Lower California, where the Indians already
knew about the pearl fisheries. This was what
he thought was an island, and what he named
California.</p>

<p>One of his officers sailed around the island
of St. Thomas, and on a Sunday morning he said
he saw a merman swimming close to his ship.</p>

<p>"It came alongside the vessel," he declared,
"and raised its head and looked at us two or
three times. It was as full of antics as a monkey.
Sometimes it would dive, and then raise up out of
the water and wash its face with its hands. Finally
a sea bird drove it away."</p>

<p>Of course he was mistaken, for what he really
did see was either a walrus or a big seal as both
animals abound in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>It was more than three hundred years after
Cabrillo sailed into the Gate of Palms at the
entrance to the bay of San Diego, before gold was
discovered in California. The country had been
settled by Spanish Cavaliers and padres and there
were missions for the teaching of the Indians.
Mexico had rebelled against the King of Spain and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
the United States had made war on Mexico and
won. Then a man by the name of Marshall found
some free gold. It was in the sand at the bottom
of a ditch he was digging to get water to run a
sawmill he was building. He knew at once that
the bright yellow pebbles he held in his hands were
gold, so he hurried to the men at work on the
watershed and said:</p>

<p>"I have found it!" and that is what the motto,
<i>Eureka!</i> on the state shield of California really
means.</p>

<p>"What is it you have found, Mr. Marshall?"
asked the men.</p>

<p>"Gold!" he exclaimed, excitedly. The men
threw down their tools and gathered about him to
examine the new find.</p>

<p>"No, no; you are mistaken," they said, when
they had turned the pebbles over, and held them
to the light, and hammered them with a stone.</p>

<p>"I am certain that it is," he stoutly maintained,
but they only laughed at him. He paid no
attention to them but turned on the water the next
night. Then he picked up all the yellow lumps
he found in the sand, and putting them into a little
bag hastened to the man for whom he was building
the mill, and said:</p>

<p>"I have found gold at the sawmill, and want
you to come and see for yourself."</p>

<p>His employer tested and weighed the shining
mass carefully, and finally said:</p>

<p>"You are right. It is real gold. Go back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
the mill, but say nothing until we get it finished.
If you do the men will quit work and we shall have
no one to take their places."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig253" id="fig253"></a>
<img src="images/i_252.jpg" width="345" height="416" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"THE DISCOVERY OF SAN FRANCISCO BAY"</p>
</div>

<p>But the secret was too good to keep, and in
a few days the whole country raised the same
sordid cry of "gold, gold, gold," which had
brought the Spaniards to the coast. In less than a
year eighty thousand people came to California
looking for gold. From an independent republic,
California became a state and with its admission
into the Union the search for El Dorado passed
from Spanish into American hands. Both the
padres and Cavaliers in California as elsewhere
in the Americas enslaved the Indians in a system
of peonage which thinned out their ranks, and
led to many hostile outbreaks before they were
finally subdued. The gold seekers had to do some
of the fighting, but they did not rob and pillage
the country, nor were they allowed to be unnecessarily
cruel. One of our great writers has said
of the Indian:</p>

<p>"The red man of America has something
peculiarly sensitive in his nature. He shrinks
instinctively from the rude touch of a foreign hand.
Like some of the dumb creatures he pines and dies
in captivity. If today we see them with their
energies broken we simply learn from that what a
terrible thing is slavery. In their faltering steps
and meek and melancholy aspect we read the sad
characteristics of a <i>conquered</i> race."</p>

<p>His faith in the traditions of his forefathers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
the belief that the Golden Hearted would come
again to bring him all that his heart desired finally
enslaved and ruined him.</p>

<p>If we pity the Indian we must also feel sorry
for the miserable ending of all the Spanish leaders
who searched for El Dorado. Columbus spent the
last years of his life in prison; Balboa, who discovered
the Pacific Ocean, was treacherously executed
and lies in an unknown grave near Panama;
Pizarro was assassinated and buried in Peru;
Magellan was killed by the natives in the Philippine
Islands; Cortez was accused of strangling his
wife to death, and finally deprived of all honors
and wealth; Guzman died in poverty and distress
while Coronado was said to be insane after his
return to Mexico. For the crime and violence done
by Spain in these expeditions she has not only lost
all the revenues, but no longer owns a foot of land
in any part of the new world.</p>

<p>Let us be thankful that the wisdom and liberty
of our own government has saved us from making
such terrible mistakes, and doing such grievous
wrongs in our attempts to find El Dorado. The
brave men and women who crossed the plains long
before we had a railroad were willing to work for
the riches they wanted. They did not come with
the idea of robbing anybody, and when they found
the gold they were generous and kind to less fortunate
neighbors and friends.</p>

<p>"In this land of sunshine and flowers," they
said, "we find gold in the crops of the chickens we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
have for our Sunday dinners, and our children
build doll-houses with the odd-shaped nuggets
given to them by the big-hearted miners."</p>

<p>It is hard to imagine the stirring times that
followed. Everybody had the gold fever, and in
crossing the plains they heard the name El Dorado
as soon as they came near where Coronado had
been. Some of them made up a song about it,
which was for many years very popular among the
men in the mining camps. This is one verse of it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>We'll rock the cradle around Pike's Peak</p>
<p>In search of the gold dust that we seek,</p>
<p>The Indians ask us why we're here</p>
<p>We tell them we're born as free as the air,</p>
<p class="i2">And oh!</p>
<p class="i2">Boys ho!</p>
<p>To the mountains we will go</p>
<p>For there is plenty of gold</p>
<p>Out West we are told</p>
<p>In the new El Dorado.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Many of the emigrants sickened and died on
the way; others were killed by the hostile Indians,
and all were subjected to a life of hardship and
toil, because they were the builders of a new commonwealth.
Once in California they found many
trying situations, not the least of which was an
occasional fight with the huge grizzly bears that
roamed through the forests. Many times the men
were obliged to organize a hunt for the purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
of ridding a district of a nest of grizzlies. Not
only would the bears fight ferociously, but they did
not hesitate to go into a corral and carry off calves,
hogs and sheep under the very eyes of the
owner.</p>

<p>"Never for a moment imagine that a grizzly
bear will run from you," said the leader of a
hunting party filling his powder horn and putting
a box of caps into his pocket. "Take good aim
at the center of his forehead. Otherwise one shot
will not kill him, and remember that he cannot
climb. If you get into close quarters, try to get
up a tree as fast as you can."</p>

<p>"We know his trail and we are going to send
our dogs in to start him out of his den."</p>

<p>"Unless your dogs know how to attack him it
is very unsafe to let them go near. One blow from
a grizzly's paw will kill any dog, and we cannot
afford to lose any of yours," said the leader,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"My dogs know all about bear hunting. They
will keep well behind him, and after we have
crippled him, they will snap at his heels and worry
him so he cannot chase the last man who shoots
at him."</p>

<p>"Will a grizzly do that?" asked a man who
had never been in a bear hunt before.</p>

<p>"Indeed he will. If you watch closely you can
tell how many times he is hit for he will fall down,
roll over and slap himself wherever the bullet
strikes him."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>"I would not advise you to waste any time
trying to find out who fired the last shot, for the
bear will never make a mistake about it. He
knows, and is always after the last one."</p>

<p>"Separate into pairs," said the leader, when
he had finished examining the bear tracks in the
path they were following. "Take your stations
about a hundred yards apart, and when you hear
the grizzly coming, aim as I have already told you,
and then look out for trouble."</p>

<p>"Do you think we are likely to find him soon?"
asked the newcomer, nervously.</p>

<p>"He is in that thicket where the dogs are
keeping up such a loud barking. You will hear
him snapping and growling in a few minutes."</p>

<p>"The grass and underbrush are so high I am
afraid I will not be able to see him," said the timid,
inexperienced hunter.</p>

<p>"You can tell by the way the dogs bark when
he is coming, and you can easily hear the click of
his sharp claws before he gets too near for comfort,"
said the leader, with a smile. "Make sure
that the trigger of your gun is properly set, and
you will be all right."</p>

<p>He had stationed other men farther up the
ravine, and in a few minutes the dogs yelped
warningly, and the man at the upper station
shouted:</p>

<p>"Look out! here he comes!"</p>

<p>"Bang!" went the gun, and then the dogs
rushed by in a solid pack with a huge she bear
at their heels.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>"There are two of them," somebody said, and
in a moment everything was in the wildest
confusion.</p>

<p>"Man alive! don't you see that wounded
grizzly rolling in the grass. He is not badly hurt,
but he will be after you in a second. Give him
another dose, and run," said the leader excitedly,
to the new hunter who was standing stock still
and gazing around him helplessly. He did not
seem to hear what was said, and before he recovered
from his paralyzing fright, the bear grabbed
him.</p>

<p>"Help! help! help! For God's sake come
here! I am being killed!" he screamed.</p>

<p>"Lie perfectly still and pretend you are
dead," said the leader. "Make no sound when I
shoot, and crawl behind that big rock as soon as
you get up."</p>

<p>The knowing dogs barked and raged around
the bear until he could not tear the prostrate man.
They kept him turning round and round, and the
daring hunter coolly waited until his head was
away from the wounded man's, and then he shot
him through the fore leg. Down he fell and kicked
and scratched the fallen hunter, but true to his
instinct got up and gave chase to the leader, with
the dogs in full cry behind him. The wounded
man managed to reach the rock, and by scrambling
up on its jagged sides was comparatively safe.
From his height he could see what the other men
were doing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>"I am all right," called the leader from a
neighboring tree, "but how is it with you?"</p>

<p>"My powder-horn is crushed and broken and
my arm is bitten through. There is blood running
down my face too, but I think that is only
scratches."</p>

<p>"Bang!" went a gun near by, and turning
to look both men saw one of the party standing
up in the saddle, on the horse brought along to
carry the game.</p>

<p>"Get out of that thicket! You will be killed
if you try to stay there," shouted the leader.</p>

<p>"My only chance is to shoot as I stand,"
answered the man, busy loading his gun. "I can
not make this horse move. But for the Mexican
stiff-bit in his mouth and a vigorous use of my
big spurs he would lie down with me."</p>

<p>"I am coming to help you," said the leader,
sliding down the limb of the tree to the ground.
"I will ham-string the grizzly and then you can
finish him."</p>

<p>He was an excellent shot, and soon the bear
was dragging his hind quarters and showing signs
of weakness from loss of blood. The man in the
saddle deliberately aimed at his heart, and after
a few convulsive struggles the grizzly lay dead.</p>

<p>The barking of the dogs and the reports of
the guns brought the whole party together, and
after bandaging the wounds of their companion,
and sending him home on the horse the remaining
men went in search of the she bear. They had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
wounded her and it was not hard to track her to a
small stream, where they found her sitting on her
haunches and groaning like a human being.</p>

<p>"That sounds too much like a woman's
moans," said the men, "and we will slip away
without being seen and let her alone."</p>

<p>As they walked home they took turns in carrying
the skin of the grizzly they had killed.</p>

<p>"He would weigh two thousand pounds and
could jump fully twenty feet," they said.</p>

<h2>The New El Dorado</h2>

<div>
<img  class="drop-cap" src="images/i_261.jpg" style="margin-top:-1.5em;" width="150" height="152" alt="O" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ONE day long after the gold
excitement in California had
subsided, a strange craft sailed
into San Francisco bay flying a
flag different from any other
ship in the harbor. It was a
yellow satin banner showing
the imperial double eagles of
the Russian Czar, and the
guns at the forts fired a royal salute as the vessel
passed by on its way to the wharf. On board
was a man empowered by the Czar to sell Alaska
to the United States, and waiting on shore to greet
him was a Senator who was appointed to make
an offer for the territory.</p>

<p>"You are very welcome, my friend," said the
Senator, grasping the hand of the Diplomat, as he
came ashore. "Your arrival gives my countrymen
much pleasure, and I earnestly hope that we may
be able to make the ties of friendship between your
people and mine very much stronger."</p>

<p>"His Majesty, the Czar, charged me to make
plain to you his sentiments of good will and his
desire to render your government a service."</p>

<p>The two men pushed their way through the
crowd and were soon being driven rapidly toward
the Senator's residence. After dinner that evening,
while sitting by the fire the Diplomat said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know the Russian story of the discovery
of Alaska, the Great Land, as we called it?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the Senator, "I do not. I only
know that it was a curious freak of fortune that
your people should be the ones to discover the
fabled 'Straits of Anian' so long sought by the
Spaniards, Portuguese and English navigators.
Bering's Sea is very far from India, but it is the
famous northwest passage, that separates Asia
from America." The Diplomat said:</p>

<p>"While Europe was exploring and settling the
Americas my countrymen were throwing off the
yoke that made them subjects of the Khans of
Tartary. Even at that time we had a great caravan
trade with China and Persia, but our merchants
suffered severely from the depredations of the Cossack
freebooters roaming over the steppes of
Siberia. These reckless horsemen would charge
down on a caravan and rob it of all its silks, spices,
teas and perfumes."</p>

<p>"Then you can sympathize with the galleons of
Spain that were harassed by the buccaneers and
pirates infesting the high seas ready to scuttle and
sink any ship that fell into their hands," said the
Senator, greatly interested.</p>

<p>"Our merchants had no redress and they complained
bitterly to Peter the Great, who immediately
undertook to chastise the unruly Cossacks.
They fled into Siberia, and it was not long before
they found rich silver mines on the Amoor river,
and began to traffic in the ivory and sable skins
which make that vicinity notable. As they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
advanced toward the Pacific Ocean they were able
to slaughter herds of musk oxen, and before many
years the fame of the ivory deposits brought hundreds
of adventurers into that barren region. Diligent
inquiry among the natives disclosed the fact
that there was a Great Land toward the North Pole
where remains of the hairy elephant were plentiful,
and its beautiful tusks were heaped up in huge
mounds."</p>

<p>"It was a desire for gold that brought the
first white men to California," said the Senator,
"and the building of the railroad across the continent
is the result of having found it."</p>

<p>"Ivory and furs were the lure that nerved the
Russian freebooter to brave the frozen sea and six
months of night," said the Diplomat. "They went
to sea in open boats made of planks tied together
with rawhide straps and thongs. Their sails were
of soft dressed reindeer skins, and in place of rope
they used elk skin strips. The anchors were pieces
of wood weighted with stones. They had no beds,
and carried a wooden plate and spoon tied to the
sash around their waists."</p>

<p>"They must have suffered very much from
cold and hunger," said the Senator.</p>

<p>"They did; and many of them died with
scurvy. They were greatly hindered by glaciers
and icebergs, and would never have been able to
make the journey at all except for the sleds and
dogs furnished by the natives."</p>

<p>"Were the Eskimos and Aleuts always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
friendly?" asked the Senator. The Diplomat
hesitated for a moment, then said with a smile:</p>

<p>"The freebooters found it necessary to fight
after they had once ill-treated the natives. At first
the white men were supposed to be superior beings,
but they proved themselves unworthy of confidence
and then there was serious trouble."</p>

<p>"We have had a somewhat similar experience
in dealing with the Indians in this country," replied
the Senator.</p>

<p>"In one of the numerous attempts made by
the freebooters to reach the Great Land, they fell
in with some Japanese castaways who claimed to
have found gold and silver there in abundance.
When this was reported to Peter the Great he
organized a scientific and military expedition under
Bering to find Alaska, with the hope that it would
lead to commercial relations with America and
Japan."</p>

<p>"It seems a hard fate that Bering should die
of scurvy in the winter when all was dark as night
and exceedingly cold," said the Senator.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the Diplomat, "especially
after he had survived the six weary years of hardship
and toil necessary to march across Siberia.
It is possible that he would have failed at last had
he not noted the flight of the land birds and known
that there must be a shore-line not far away."</p>

<p>"Did he or his family profit by the discoveries
he made?"</p>

<p>"Very little. It has been the fate of all the
Russian explorers in America to die poor,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
responded the Diplomat. "It has cost my government
vast sums of money and more than two hundred
years have elapsed since the first efforts were
made. We have profited greatly by the seal fisheries
and so will your people when once Alaska
becomes a territory of the United States."</p>

<p>"It has always been a puzzle to me why the
Czar recalled the Russian colonists living in peace
and prosperity in California under Spanish rule,"
said the Senator, after a pause.</p>

<p>"It was because he wished to maintain friendly
relations with the United States and he was far-sighted
enough to see that California would some
day come under the American flag. It is to increase
that feeling that he now offers to sell Alaska to you.
He does not wish to have any possessions on this
continent. The destiny of Russia lies in another
direction."</p>

<p>Both the Senator and Diplomat went to see the
President and it was not very long until the purchase
was made. When the Senator came back
from Washington he said:</p>

<p>"We have paid exactly two cents an acre for
Alaska, and its seal fisheries are well worth that
amount. We will not have to fight for its possession,
and I am certain that we have made a good
bargain."</p>

<p>Since then many men have sailed into the
northern waters and come back with cargoes of
whale oil, or seal skins or canned salmon, but no
one paid any particular attention to them. A party
of scientific men explored the Yukon river which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
is as long and as wide as the Mississippi and made
the ascent of Mount St. Elias, one of the loftiest
peaks in North America, but nobody was interested
in Alaska except as a place where the sun shines
for six months and then leaves the whole country
in partial darkness for another six months.</p>

<p>Imagine the sun apparently traveling around
in a little circle all the time. There are no sunrises
and no sunsets, and no need of lights at night. Then
when it goes down, lamps or candles must be burned
all the time. When the extreme cold comes the
aurora borealis sends out splendid rays of many
colored lights to burnish up the vault of heaven
and make a grand electrical display.</p>

<p>The Eskimos are a dwarfed race of men and
women with flat noses, and eyes wide apart, and
they dress themselves in heavy furs with the hair
turned next to the body. They live on fish and
whale blubber, and are experts in throwing a spear
or managing a skin canoe. In front of their homes
they have curious totem poles to show what tribes
they belong to, and they are quite ingenious in
weaving fish-nets, baskets, and in the carving of
silver and ivory.</p>

<p>For many years no news came from Alaska,
except by ship, and on a warm, sunny day in
autumn not long ago, some sailors set up the cry:</p>

<p>"Gold has been found in Alaska! It is the
new El Dorado! It is richer than California!"</p>

<p>At first people did not believe them, but when
the experts passed upon the findings everybody
said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us go to the Klondike! We can get rich
in a few months."</p>

<p>The excitement was so great that it did no good
to point out the hardships and dangers of such
an undertaking.</p>

<p>"We will take the chances of freezing," they
said, carelessly. "We can walk over the mountain
passes and we do not care about the discomforts."</p>

<p>"But only a few can find the gold. It was the
same in California. Not one in a thousand can
possibly bring away as much gold as he takes with
him to live on, for food will be very scarce and
high priced," urged the prudent ones.</p>

<p>"You will freeze," said others, "or will die
with scurvy, or be eaten by those terrible white
polar bears and wolves."</p>

<p>"No matter what you say to us we are going,"
was the reply, and every ship that could be found
was loaded with eager men, and some venturesome
women bent upon wresting the gold from the
frozen north. Many of them had never seen an
iceberg or a glacier, and had no idea what misery
awaited them.</p>

<p>"Write us as soon as you can," said the wives
and mothers tearfully, as they stood on the wharf
in some seaport of the Pacific saying good by to
some loved one, going to seek a fortune.</p>

<p>"It will be six months before this ship can
return," said the captain of one of the first ships
that carried gold seekers to Alaska in answer to
an anxious inquiry as to how long it will be before
the promised letters could arrive.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>"Why will you be so long?" asks some little
boy or girl whose heart is sad at parting with
their beloved father.</p>

<p>"Because the great ice-floes will close in on
our vessel and we will not be able to move until
the weather moderates."</p>

<p>"Then will you bring my father back to me?"
asks the simple child.</p>

<p>"I hope so, my dear," and then the kindly face
of the captain looks serious and he mutters to
himself, "God forbid that it should be a grave
instead of a fortune that awaits this child's father."</p>

<p>The first season many a brave man sailed away,
full of hope and expectancy, but the next year
returned haggard, worn and in some instances a
hopeless invalid.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the gold fields of
Alaska?" asks his old friends as they shake his
hand.</p>

<p>"It is a place to suffer and grow old in; a
place to lose the earnings of a lifetime, and your
health with them. In the long, dreary, dark nights
the stoutest heart loses courage, and next to longing
for home is the longing for death."</p>

<p>If he were one of the fortunate few who found
the grains of free gold deposited in the frozen
sands, he had a sobered, prematurely old look and
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I have made money in the gold fields
of Alaska, but I hope I may never be obliged to
go back and live in the mines."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<p>Strewn along the trail and over the Chilkoot
Pass are the bleaching bones of those who
sacrificed their lives in the effort to reach the new
El Dorado. The simple Eskimos looked on in
wonder at the frantic energy of their white
brothers, and were content in their own security.</p>

<p>The Ice Queen is their guardian and she punishes
those who venture into her frigid realm to
unearth and carry away the hidden treasures. In
Alaska, as everywhere else, one must work hard and
build up the country instead of robbing it, if money
is really to be made. The late comers have already
learned this lesson, by experience, and are beginning
to build railroads, good houses, schools and
churches in the warmest and most fertile part of
the country surrounding the seaports.</p>

<p>And we know at last that El Dorado exists
solely in the hearts and minds of men, and not in
the everlasting snows of Alaska.</p>
